Trained in mechanical engineering and art history, he was convinced that technology was making society not only more exciting but more democratic. His combination of academic rigor and pop culture sensibility put him in opposition to both traditionalists and orthodox Modernists, but placed him in a unique position to understand the cultural, social, and political implications of the visual arts in the postwar period. His first book, Theory and Design in the First Machine Age (still in print with The MIT Press after forty years), was central to the overhaul of Modernism, and it gave Futurism and Expressionism credibility amid the dynamism and change of the 1960s.This intellectual biography is the first comprehensive critical examination of Banham\u2019s theories and ideas, not only on architecture but also on the wide variety of subjects that interested him. It covers the full range of his oeuvre and discusses the values, enthusiasms, and influences that formed his thinking.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Whiteley__Reyner_Banham_Historian_of_the_Immediate_Future/Whiteley__Reyner_Banham_Historian_of_the_Immediate_Future.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Whiteley__Reyner_Banham_Historian_of_the_Immediate_Future/Whiteley__Reyner_Banham_Historian_of_the_Immediate_Future.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Whiteley__Reyner_Banham_Historian_of_the_Immediate_Future/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Whiteley__Reyner_Banham_Historian_of_the_Immediate_Future/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Whiteley__Reyner_Banham_Historian_of_the_Immediate_Future/Whiteley RBHotIF.zip"]},

Every building contains clues embedded in its design that identify not only its architectural style but also who designed it, what kind of congregation it was built for, and why. This practical yet charming handbook is the key to decoding the style, history, evolution, and social significance of religious buildings. Not strictly limited to churches, it also covers abbeys, chapels, and monasteries, among other structures. Organized according to architectural element (windows, domes, arches, etc.), each element is presented in chronological order. Additional chapters explore the architectural influence of geography, history, and various creeds, along with an illustrated timeline showing how, where, and in many cases why certain church features evolved through the centuries. There is also a useful introduction to naming each component of a church, from vaults to buttresses and transepts to apses. All entries are illustrated with period engravings and line drawings. This book will be invaluable for architecture buffs and anyone who has ever wondered why classic New England churches are white with little ornament, why Quaker meetinghouses have no altars, or why Episcopalians traditionally favored the Gothic style.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_McNamara__How_to_Read_Churches/McNamara__How_to_Read_Churches.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_McNamara__How_to_Read_Churches/McNamara__How_to_Read_Churches.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_McNamara__How_to_Read_Churches/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_McNamara__How_to_Read_Churches/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_McNamara__How_to_Read_Churches/McNamara HtRC.zip"]},

For classical architects, the term Palladian stands for a vocabulary of architectural forms embodying perfection and beauty. Of even greater significance than Palladio\u2019s buildings is his treatise I quattro libri dell\u2019architettura (The Four Books On Architecture), the most successful architectural treatise of the Renaissance and one of the two or three most important books in the literature of architecture. First published in Italian in 1570, it has been translated into every major Western language. This is the first English translation of Palladio in over 250 years, making it the only translation available in modern English. Until now, English-language readers have had to rely mostly on a facsimile of Isaac Ware\u2019s 1738 translation and the eighteenth-century engravings prepared for that text. This new translation by Robert Tavernor and Richard Schofield contains Palladio\u2019s original woodcuts, reproduced in facsimile and positioned correctly, adjacent to the text. The book also contains a glossary that explains technical terms in their original context, a bibliography of recent Palladio research, and an introduction to Palladio and his times. The First Book discusses building materials and techniques, as well as the five orders of architecture: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite. Palladio describes the characteristics of each order and illustrates them. The Second Book discusses private town houses and country estates, almost all designed by Palladio. The Third Book discusses streets, bridges, piazzas, and basilicas, most of ancient Roman origin. The Fourth Book discusses ancient Roman temples, including the Pantheon.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Tavernor__Andrea_Palladio_The_Four_Books_on_Architecture/Tavernor__Andrea_Palladio_The_Four_Books_on_Architecture.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Tavernor__Andrea_Palladio_The_Four_Books_on_Architecture/Tavernor__Andrea_Palladio_The_Four_Books_on_Architecture.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Tavernor__Andrea_Palladio_The_Four_Books_on_Architecture/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Tavernor__Andrea_Palladio_The_Four_Books_on_Architecture/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Tavernor__Andrea_Palladio_The_Four_Books_on_Architecture/Tavernor APTFBoA.zip"]},

His theories, which the French press has termed \u201cl\u2019hypoth\u00e8se girardienne,\u201d have sparked interdisciplinary, even international, controversy. In The Scapegoat, Girard applies his approach to \u201ctexts of persecution,\u201d documents that recount phenomena of collective violence from the standpoint of the persecutor\u0097documents such as the medieval poet Guillaume de Machaut\u2019s Judgement of the King of Navarre, which blames the Jews for the Black Death and describes their mass murder.Girard compares persecution texts with myths, most notably with the myth of Oedipus, and finds strikingly similar themes and structures. Could myths regularly conceal texts of persecution? Girard\u2019s answers lies in a study of the Christian Passion, which represents the same central event, the same collective violence, found in all mythology, but which is read from the point of view of the innocent victim. The Passion text provides the model interpretation that has enabled Western culture to demystify its own violence\u0097a demystification Girard now extends to mythology.Underlying Girard\u2019s daring textual hypothesis is a powerful theory of history and culture. Christ\u2019s rejection of all guilt breaks the mythic cycle of violence and the sacred.

Written by the famous nonobjective painter Wassily Kandinsky (1866\u20131944), it explains Kandinsky\u2019s own theory of painting and crystallizes the ideas that were influencing many other modern artists of the period. Along with his own groundbreaking paintings, this book had a tremendous impact on the development of modern art.Kandinsky\u2019s ideas are presented in two parts. The first part, called \u201cAbout General Aesthetic,\u201d issues a call for a spiritual revolution in painting that will let artists express their own inner lives in abstract, non-material terms. Just as musicians do not depend upon the material world for their music, so artists should not have to depend upon the material world for their art. In the second part, \u201cAbout Painting,\u201d Kandinsky discusses the psychology of colors, the language of form and color, and the responsibilities of the artist. An Introduction by the translator, Michael T. H. Sadler, offers additional explanation of Kandinsky\u2019s art and theories, while a new Preface by Richard Stratton discusses Kandinsky\u2019s career as a whole and the impact of the book. Making the book even more valuable are nine woodcuts by Kandinsky himself that appear at the chapter headings.This English translation of \u00dcber das Geistige in der Kunst was a significant contribution to the understanding of nonobjectivism in art.

MCCREA, F.R.S. \u2018THE only justification for our concepts and system of concepts is that they serve to represent the complex of our experiences; beyond this they have no legitimacy. \u2018 So Einstein writes on page 2 of this book. Most present-day physicists would agree, and many before Einstein must have held the same opinion. Einstein, however, put the opinion into practice to better purpose than any physicist before him. And for Einstein it evidently meant what it means for most of us today: a theory is the construction of a theoretical model of the world of physics; all the mathematical discussion applies to the model; the model embodies the \u2018system of concepts\u2019, and it serves \u2018to represent the complex of our experiences\u2019 if the experience of the theoretical observer in the theoretical model can be put into satisfactory correspondence with the experi ence of the actual observer in the actual physical world. Classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism pro vide models that are good representations of two sets of actual experiences. As Einstein was the first fully to appreciate, however, it is not possible to combine these into a single self-consistent model. The construction of the simplest possible self-consistent model is the achieve ment of Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity. The theory is found, in particular, to give a satisfactory representation of the electromagnetic interaction between charged particles through its use of the concept of the electromagnetic field.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Einstein__The_Meaning_of_Relativity/Einstein__The_Meaning_of_Relativity.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Einstein__The_Meaning_of_Relativity/Einstein__The_Meaning_of_Relativity.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Einstein__The_Meaning_of_Relativity/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Einstein__The_Meaning_of_Relativity/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Einstein__The_Meaning_of_Relativity/Einstein TMoR.zip"]},

This series of Triumphal Entries was celebrated to introduce Philip as the next sovereign of the Netherlands. The common characteristic of all these entries, starting with Brussels and ending with Antwerp, was their fusion of different traditions and their adaptation to the new imperial concept. But Antwerp executed a full assimilation of the classicist style and the imperial concept that Charles V tried to promote. As such, the Antwerp Entry of 1549 is fundamental to any understanding of the development of the Joyeuse Entr\u00e9e in the Low Countries: to the interweaving of the Italian humanistic tradition of the imperial Triumphal Entry with the local tradition of the vow-taking ceremony, i.e., the Joyeuse Entr\u00e9e or Blijde Inkomst.

The only characteristic of the genius that is of philosophical importance in these theories is the capacity to produce great art. Analysis of this capacity, however, if not relegated to a philosophically \u201cirrelevant\u201d psychology, is accounted for only in general if sometimes heroic terms. For Kant, the status is impersonal and cosmological: Genius, marvelously anointed as \u201cnature\u2019s voice,\u201d provides a rational face for the noumenal world through the purity and completeness of its representations, and thereby offers us hope of a continuity between the world and our perceptions.

Written by the famous nonobjective painter Wassily Kandinsky (1866\u20131944), it explains Kandinsky\u2019s own theory of painting and crystallizes the ideas that were influencing many other modern artists of the period. Along with his own groundbreaking paintings, this book had a tremendous impact on the development of modern art.Kandinsky\u2019s ideas are presented in two parts. The first part, called \u201cAbout General Aesthetic,\u201d issues a call for a spiritual revolution in painting that will let artists express their own inner lives in abstract, non-material terms. Just as musicians do not depend upon the material world for their music, so artists should not have to depend upon the material world for their art. In the second part, \u201cAbout Painting,\u201d Kandinsky discusses the psychology of colors, the language of form and color, and the responsibilities of the artist. An Introduction by the translator, Michael T. H.

Although Goethe\u2019s work was rejected by physicists, a number of philosophers and physicists have concerned themselves with it, including Thomas Johann Seebeck, Arthur Schopenhauer (see: On Vision and Colors), Hermann von Helmholtz, Rudolf Steiner, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Werner Heisenberg, Kurt Godel, and Mitchell Feigenbaum. Goethe\u2019s book provides a catalogue of how colour is perceived in a wide variety of circumstances, and considers Isaac Newton\u2019s observations to be special cases. Unlike Newton, Goethe\u2019s concern was not so much with the analytic treatment of colour, as with the qualities of how phenomena are perceived.

Through engagement with a range of illustrative examples from contested contemporary and historical architectural projects, Paul Jones analyses some of the ways in which architects have sought to position their architecture relative to state projects and wider publics. A central objective of the book is to situate major architectural projects as a research agenda for sociologists and others interested in the relationship between power, culture, and collective identities.Adopting a critical approach to such questions, The Sociology of Architecture frames architecture as a field of contestation over symbolic and material resources, which in turn provides an entry point for questioning the inextricably political ways in which collective identities are constructed, maintained and mobilized.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Jones__The_Sociology_of_Architecture/Jones__The_Sociology_of_Architecture.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Jones__The_Sociology_of_Architecture/Jones__The_Sociology_of_Architecture.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Jones__The_Sociology_of_Architecture/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Jones__The_Sociology_of_Architecture/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Jones__The_Sociology_of_Architecture/Jones TSA.zip"]},

As everyone from slave to senator met in this communal space, city dwellers found unparalleled opportunities for self-aggrandizing display and the negotiation of social and political tensions.

It was the first complete philosophical exposition for separating the beautiful and the sublime into their own respective rational categories. It attracted the attention of prominent thinkers such as Denis Diderot and Immanuel Kant.The idea of the sublime is central to a Romantic\u2019s perception of, and heightened awareness in, the world. It was Edmund Burke, who in 1757 published a treatise of aesthetics called A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful, and therefore provided the English Romantic movement with a systematic analysis of what constitutes the sublime, and the various qualities which it possesses, and hence gave the English Romantics a theoretical foundation, and a legitimacy, to their artistic expression.Consistent with the dominant philosophical way of thinking in Britain during his life, Burke was an empiricist. That is, he believed that the formation of our ideas, and our knowledge of the natural world, is derived from our sensory experience, which is determined by our senses, perceptions or passions (feelings or emotions). This is to be contrasted with the rationalist school of thought, which asserts that knowledge of innate ideas can be arrived at through intuition and reasoning alone, independently of the passions. For Burke, it is the passions (as represented in our imagination), not reason, which determines how and what we see, hear and feel in the world.Like most empiricists, Burke sought to apply a scientific method to his chosen subject-matter, so in the Enquiry he undertakes a scientific investigation into our various passions, and uses the collected evidence to explain the nature and power of the sublime. His Enquiry opens with an introductory discussion on taste, where he observes that although we have a shared sensory apparatus, our idea and knowledge of a particular taste (and whether we like it or not) is the product of our own individual physical experience, combined with our social and cultural context:Thus opium is pleasing to the Turks, on account of the agreeable delirium it produces. Tobacco is the delight of Dutchmen, as it diffuses a torpor and pleasing stupefaction. Fermented spirits please our common people, because they banish care, and all consideration of future or present evils.Burke then turns to his observations on the sublime. He asserts that ideas of pain are much more powerful than those of pleasure, and that the strongest pain of all is the fear of death, which causes terror. As such:Whatever is fitted in any sort to excite the ideas of pain, and danger, that is to say, whatever is in any sort terrible, or is conversant about terrible objects, or operates in a manner analogous to terror, is a source of the sublime; that is, it is productive of the strongest emotion which the mind is capable of feeling.The sublime, then, is our strongest passion, and it is grounded in terror. Yet it is not exclusively an unpleasant emotion, for danger or pain can, in certain circumstances, give us delight. And the sublime has other qualities: it overwhelms our faculty of reason, such that we are rendered incapable of rational thought. As Burke puts it:The passion caused by the great and the sublime in nature, when those causes operate most powerfully, is Astonishment; and astonishment is that state of the soul, in which all its motions are suspended, with some degree of horror.This heightened state of astonishment, where reason is driven out by \u201can irresistible force\u201d, and \u201cthe mind is so entirely filled with its object, that it cannot entertain another\u201d, is more terrible to us when it is accompanied with a sense of the unknown (or what Burke calls obscurity). For Burke, obscurity is an absence of clarity, whether in the sensory darkness of sight (or blinding lightness), or mental uncertainty of thought. As he observes, \u201ceveryone will be sensible to this, who considers how greatly night adds to our dread\u201d. He notes how religions have used darkness to create fear, such that \u201cthe druids performed all their ceremonies in the bosom of the darkest woods, and in the shade of the oldest and most spreading oaks\u201d. Further, it is vastness, or \u201cgreatness of dimension\u201d, which is \u201ca powerful cause of the sublime\u201d, where \u201clooking down from a precipice\u201d on a mountain has greater impact depending of its depth and steepness, and where \u201cthe effects of a rugged and broken surface seem stronger than where it is smooth and polished\u201d. Finally, another source of the sublime is what Burke calls infinity, where the eye is not able to \u201cperceive the bounds\u201d of something, or \u201csee an object distinctly\u201d, and this gives rise to a \u201cterrible uncertainty of the thing\u201d perceived. For Burke: \u201cInfinity has a tendency to fill the mind with that sort of delightful horror, which is the most genuine effect, and truest test of the sublime\u201d.Burke believed that poetic verse is the most powerfully effective art form in evoking an emotional response, and Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost the finest example of \u201cheightening, or of setting terrible things\u201d. In Milton\u2019s description of Death, says Burke, it \u201cis astonishing with what a gloomy pomp, with what a significant and expressive uncertainty of strokes and colouring he has finished the portrait of the king of terrors. The other shape, If shape it might be called that shape had none Distinguishable,\u2026\u2026.black he stood as night: Fierce as ten furies: terrible as hell:\u2026\u2026 In this description all is dark, uncertain, confused, terrible, and sublime to the last degree.\u201d", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Burke__A_Philosophical_Enquiry_into_the_Origin_of_our_ideas_of_the_Sublime_and_Beautiful/Burke__A_Philosophical_Enquiry_into_the_Origin_of_our_ideas_of_the_Sublime_and_Beautiful.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Burke__A_Philosophical_Enquiry_into_the_Origin_of_our_ideas_of_the_Sublime_and_Beautiful/Burke__A_Philosophical_Enquiry_into_the_Origin_of_our_ideas_of_the_Sublime_and_Beautiful.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Burke__A_Philosophical_Enquiry_into_the_Origin_of_our_ideas_of_the_Sublime_and_Beautiful/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Burke__A_Philosophical_Enquiry_into_the_Origin_of_our_ideas_of_the_Sublime_and_Beautiful/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Burke__A_Philosophical_Enquiry_into_the_Origin_of_our_ideas_of_the_Sublime_and_Beautiful/Burke OSB.zip"]},

This treatise offers a window onto the architectural ideals of the 1500s, as well as then-current notions of philosophy, mathematics, music, astronomy, mechanics, and more. The text is accompanied by illustrations by the Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio and his contemporaries. Palladio\u2019s own Four Books on Architecture, published in 1570, was just one of many treatises on architecture that was inspired by the ideas contained here.An overview of Daniele Barbaro\u2019s thinking is presented in a foreword by Branko Mitrovic\u00b4. The collocation of Barbaro\u2019s treatise between those of Alberti and Palladio is addressed in a foreword by Robert Tavernor. Kim Williams provides a translator\u2019s note to orient the reader.

They were also venues for hospitality, conversation, and thinking on pagan, and ultimately Christian, themes. Villas spread as the Empire grew. Like towns and cities, they became the means of power and assimilation, just as infrastructure, such as aqueducts and bridges, was transforming the Mediterranean into a Roman sea.

In this long-awaited book, completed shortly before its author\u2019s death, Evans recasts the idea of the relationship between geometry and architecture, drawing on mathematics, engineering, art history, and aesthetics to uncover processes in the imagining and realizing of architectural form. He shows that geometry does not always play a stolid and dormant role but, in fact, may be an active agent in the links between thinking and imagination, imagination and drawing, drawing and building. He suggests a theory of architecture that is based on the many transactions between architecture and geometry as evidenced in individual buildings, largely in Europe, from the fifteenth to the twentieth century.From the Henry VII chapel at Westminster Abbey to Le Corbusier\u2019s Ronchamp, from Raphael\u2019s S. Eligio and the work of Piero della Francesca and Philibert Delorme to Guarino Guarini and the painters of cubism, Evans explores the geometries involved, asking whether they are in fact the stable underpinnings of the creative, intuitive, or rhetorical aspects of architecture. In particular he concentrates on the history of architectural projection, the geometry of vision that has become an internalized and pervasive pictorial method of construction and that, until now, has played only a small part in the development of architectural theory.Evans describes the ambivalent role that pictures play in architecture and urges resistance to the idea that pictures provide all that architects need, suggesting that there is much more within the scope of the architect\u2019s vision of a project than what can be drawn. He defines the different fields of projective transmission that concern architecture, and investigates the ambiguities of projection and the interaction of imagination with projection and its metaphors.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Evans__The_Projective_Cast_Architecture_and_Its_Three_Geometries/Evans__The_Projective_Cast_Architecture_and_Its_Three_Geometries.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Evans__The_Projective_Cast_Architecture_and_Its_Three_Geometries/Evans__The_Projective_Cast_Architecture_and_Its_Three_Geometries.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Evans__The_Projective_Cast_Architecture_and_Its_Three_Geometries/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Evans__The_Projective_Cast_Architecture_and_Its_Three_Geometries/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Evans__The_Projective_Cast_Architecture_and_Its_Three_Geometries/Evans TPC.zip"]},

It was initially published in French (as Le Capital au XXIe si\u00e8cle) in August 2013; an English translation by Arthur Goldhammer followed in April 2014.The book\u2019s central thesis is that when the rate of return on capital (r) is greater than the rate of economic growth (g) over the long term, the result is concentration of wealth, and this unequal distribution of wealth causes social and economic instability. Piketty proposes a global system of progressive wealth taxes to help reduce inequality and avoid the vast majority of wealth coming under the control of a tiny minority.However, at the end of 2014, Piketty released a paper where he stated that he does not consider the relationship between the rate of return on capital and the rate of economic growth as the only or primary tool for considering changes in income and wealth inequality. He also noted that r > g is not a useful tool for the discussion of rising inequality of labor income.On May 18, 2014, the English edition reached number one on The New York Times Best Seller list for best selling hardcover nonfiction and became the greatest sales success ever of academic publisher Harvard University Press.

For hundreds of years, the specific instructions he gave in his \u201cTen Books on Architecture\u201d were followed faithfully, and major buildings in all parts of the world reveal the widespread influence of his precepts. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, he was \u201cthe chief authority studied by architects, and in every point his precepts were accepted as final. Bramante, Michelangelo, Palladio, Vignola, and earlier were careful students of the work of Vitruvius.\u201d His book is thus one of those rare works that have been supremely important in the creation of the greatest art masterpieces.Vitruvius describes the classic principles of symmetry, harmony, and proportion in architecture; the design of the treasury, prison, senate house, baths, forum, and temples; the construction of the theater: its site, foundations, and acoustics; the proper style and proportion for private dwellings; the differences between the Ionic, Doric, and Corinthian styles; methods of giving durability and beauty to polished finishings; and many other topics that help us understand the methods and beliefs of the Roman architect.It is a direct, authoritative, and detailed introduction to the ancients\u2019 methods of construction, the materials of the architect, and the prevailing aesthetic beliefs of the times; but it is also a work of art. Vitruvius wrote in such a fascinating manner, and digressed from his subject so often (as, for instance, when he wrote about the winds, Archimedes in his bath, and why authors should receive awards and honors at least as often as athletes), that his book has had a continuing appeal to the general reader for many centuries. Besides being an instructive treatise on nearly everything connected with Roman and Greek architecture, it is an entertaining description of some aspects of the life and beliefs of the times. This edition is the standard English translation, prepared over a period of several years by Professor M. H. Morgan of Harvard University.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Vitruvius__The_Ten_Books_on_Architecture/Vitruvius__The_Ten_Books_on_Architecture.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Vitruvius__The_Ten_Books_on_Architecture/Vitruvius__The_Ten_Books_on_Architecture.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Vitruvius__The_Ten_Books_on_Architecture/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Vitruvius__The_Ten_Books_on_Architecture/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Vitruvius__The_Ten_Books_on_Architecture/Vitruvius TTBoA.zip"]},

Like civilization, play requires structure and participants willing to create within limits. Starting with Plato, Huizinga traces the contribution of Homo Ludens, or \u201cMan the player\u201d through Medieval Times, the Renaissance, and into our modern civilization. Huizinga defines play against a rich theoretical background, using cross-cultural examples from the humanities, business, and politics. Homo Ludens defines play for generations to come.In Homo Ludens, Johan Huizinga defines play as the central activity in flourishing societies. He identifies five characteristics of play: it is free; it is not \u201cordinary\u201d or \u201creal\u201d life; it is distinct from \u201cordinary\u201d life both as to locality and duration; it creates order; it is connected with no material interest, and from it no profit can be gained.With cross-cultural examples from the humanities, business, and politics, Huizinga examines play in all its diverse guises\u2014as it relates to language, law, war, knowledge, poetry, myth, philosophy, art, and much more. As he writes, \u201cCivilization is, in its earliest phases, played. It does not come from play like a baby detaching itself from the womb: it arises in and as play, and never leaves it.\u201dStarting with Plato, Huizinga traces the contribution of \u201cman the player\u201d through the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and early modern world. With an eye for our own times he writes: \u201cIn American politics [play] is even more evident. Long before the two-party system had reduced itself to two gigantic teams whose political differences were hardly discernible to an outsider, electioneering in America had developed into a kind of national sport.\u201d With its remarkable historical sweep, Homo Ludens defines play for generations to come.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Huizinga__Homo_Ludens/Huizinga__Homo_Ludens.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Huizinga__Homo_Ludens/Huizinga__Homo_Ludens.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Huizinga__Homo_Ludens/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Huizinga__Homo_Ludens/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Huizinga__Homo_Ludens/Huizinga HL.zip"]},

The poetics of lists runs throughout the history of art and literature. We do not only see it at work in ancient bestiaries, the celestial hosts of angels or the naturalist collections of the 16th century. We also find it more obliquely from Homer to Joyce, from the treasures of Gothic cathedrals to the fantastic landscapes of Bosch and cabinets of curiosities, until we get to Andy Warhol and Arman in the 20th century.

Many cannot afford housing. Austerity measures have taken a disastrous toll on public infrastructures. The climate crisis has rendered the planet vulnerable, even uninhabitable. This book offers an alternative vision in architecture and urbanism that focuses on caring for a broken planet. Rooted in a radical care perspective that always starts from the given, in the midst of things, this edited collection of essays and illustrated case studies documents ideas and practices from an extraordinarily diverse group of contributors.Focusing on the three crisis areas of economy, ecology, and labor, the book describes projects including village reconstruction in China; irrigation in Spain; community land trust in Puerto Rico; revitalization of modernist public housing in France; new alliances in informal settlements in Nairobi; and the redevelopment of traditional building methods in flood areas in Pakistan. Essays consider such topics as ethical architecture, land policy, creative ecologies, diverse economies, caring communities, and the exploitation of labor. Taken together, these case studies and essays provide evidence that architecture and urbanism have the capacity to make the planet livable, again.Essays by\nMauro Baracco, Sara Brolund de Carvalho, Jane Da Mosto, Angelika Fitz, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Frichot, Katherine Gibson, Mauro Gil-Fournier Esquerra, Valeria Graziano, Gabu Heindl, Elke Krasny, Lisa Law, Ligia Nobre, Meike Schalk, Linda Tegg, Ana Carolina Tonetti, Kim Trogal, Joan C.

The book outlines a method for analyzing the rhythms of urban spaces and the effects of those rhythms on the inhabitants of those spaces. It builds on his past work, with which he argued space is a production of social practices.The book is considered to be the fourth volume in his series Critique of Everyday Life. Published in 1992 after his death, Rhythmanalysis is the last book Lefebvre wrote.Lefebvre\u2019s concept of rhythm concerns the repetition of a measure at a frequency. He identifies two kinds of rhythms: cyclical rhythms, which involve simple intervals of repetition, and alternating (or linear) rhythms. An example of a cyclical rhythm would be day fading into night, and night brightening into day; a linear rhythm might be the flow of information from a television set. Additionally, rhythms may be nested within each other; for example, the broadcast of the local news at set intervals throughout the day, throughout the week, is an example of a nested rhythm. In a less abstract fashion (or perhaps only abstract in a different fashion), Lefebvre asserts that rhythms exist at the intersection of place, time and the expenditure of energy.Lefebvre posits that the human body is composed of several rhythms; in order to observe rhythms outside of the body, the rhythmanalyst must use her or his own rhythms as a reference to unify the rhythms under analysis. Properly put, the rhythm is the conjunction of the rhythmanalyst and the object of the analysis.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Lefebvre__Rhythmanalysis/Lefebvre__Rhythmanalysis.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Lefebvre__Rhythmanalysis/Lefebvre__Rhythmanalysis.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Lefebvre__Rhythmanalysis/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Lefebvre__Rhythmanalysis/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Lefebvre__Rhythmanalysis/Lefebvre R.zip"]},

W. Leibniz. Leibniz was above all things a metaphysician. That does not mean that his head was in the clouds, or that the particular sciences lacked interest for him. Not at all\u2013he felt a lively concern for theological debate, he was a mathematician of the first rank, he made original contributions to physics, he gave a realistic attention to moral psychology. Theodicy in its most common form, is an attempt to answer the question of why a good God permits the manifestation of evil. Some theodicies also address the evidential problem of evil by attempting \u201cto make the existence of an all-knowing, all-powerful and all-good or omnibenevolent God consistent with the existence of evil or suffering in the world.\u201d Unlike a defense, which tries to demonstrate that God\u2019s existence is logically possible in the light of evil, a theodicy attempts to provide a framework wherein God\u2019s existence is also plausible.The German mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz coined the term \u201ctheodicy\u201d in 1710 in his work Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e, though various responses to the problem of evil had been previously proposed. The British philosopher John Hick traced the history of moral theodicy in his 1966 work, Evil and the God of Love, identifying three major traditions. The problem was also analyzed by pre-modern theologians and philosophers in the Islamic world. German philosopher Max Weber (1864\u20131920) saw theodicy as a social problem, based on the human need to explain puzzling aspects of the world.Sociologist Peter L. Berger (1929\u20132017) argued that religion arose out of a need for social order, and an \u201cimplicit theodicy of all social order\u201d developed to sustain it. Following the Holocaust, a number of Jewish theologians developed a new response to the problem of evil, sometimes called anti-theodicy, which maintains that God cannot be meaningfully justified. As an alternative to theodicy, a defense has been proposed by the American philosopher Alvin Plantinga, which is focused on showing the logical possibility of God\u2019s existence. Plantinga\u2019s version of the free-will defence argued that the coexistence of God and evil is not logically impossible, and that free will further explains the existence of evil without threatening the existence of God. Similar to a theodicy, a cosmodicy attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of the universe, and an anthropodicy attempts to justify the goodness of humanity. As defined by Alvin Plantinga, theodicy is the \u201canswer to the question of why God permits evil\u201d.Theodicy is defined as a theological construct that attempts to vindicate God in response to the evidential problem of evil that mitigates against the existence of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent deity. As a response to the problem of evil, a theodicy is distinct from a defence. A defence attempts to demonstrate that the occurrence of evil does not contradict God\u2019s existence, but it does not propose that rational beings are able to understand why God permits evil. A theodicy seeks to show that it is reasonable to believe in God despite evidence of evil in the world and offers a framework which can account for why evil exists. A theodicy is often based on a prior natural theology, which attempts to prove the existence of God, and seeks to demonstrate that God\u2019s existence remains probable after the problem of evil is posed by giving a justification for God\u2019s permitting evil to happen. Defenses propose solutions to the logical problem of evil, while theodicies attempt to answer the evidential (inductive) problem.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Leibniz__Theodicy/Leibniz__Theodicy.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Leibniz__Theodicy/Leibniz__Theodicy.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Leibniz__Theodicy/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Leibniz__Theodicy/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Leibniz__Theodicy/Leibniz T.zip"]},

For the last three centuries new ideas of nature have been continually developed by theology, politics, economics, and science, especially the sciences of the material world.The situation is even more unstable today, now that we have entered an ecological mutation of unprecedented scale. Some call it the Anthropocene, but it is best described as a new climatic regime. And a new regime it certainly is, since the many unexpected connections between human activity and the natural world oblige every one of us to reopen the earlier notions of nature and redistribute what had been packed inside.So the question now arises: what will replace the old ways of looking at nature?This book explores a potential candidate proposed by James Lovelock when he chose the name \u2018Gaia\u2019 for the fragile, complex system through which living phenomena modify the Earth. The fact that he was immediately misunderstood proves simply that his readers have tried to fit this new notion into an older frame, transforming Gaia into a single organism, a kind of giant thermostat, some sort of New Age goddess, or even divine Providence.In this series of lectures on \u2018natural religion,\u2019 Bruno Latour argues that the complex and ambiguous figure of Gaia offers, on the contrary, an ideal way to disentangle the ethical, political, theological, and scientific aspects of the now obsolete notion of nature. He lays the groundwork for a future collaboration among scientists, theologians, activists, and artists as they, and we, begin to adjust to the new climatic regime.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Latour__Facing_Gaia/Latour__Facing_Gaia.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Latour__Facing_Gaia/Latour__Facing_Gaia.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Latour__Facing_Gaia/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Latour__Facing_Gaia/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Latour__Facing_Gaia/Latour FG.zip"]},

Bruno Latour\u2019s contention is that the word \u2018social\u2019, as used by Social Scientists, has become laden with assumptions to the point where it has become misnomer. When the adjective is applied to a phenomenon, it is used to indicate a stablilized state of affairs, a bundle of ties that in due course may be used to account for another phenomenon. But Latour also finds the word used as if it described a type of material, in a comparable way to an adjective such as \u2018wooden\u2019 or \u2018steely\u2019. Rather than simply indicating what is already assembled together, it is now used in a way that makes assumptions about the nature of what is assembled. It has become a word that designates two distinct things: a process of assembling; and a type of material, distinct from others. Latour shows why \u2018the social\u2019 cannot be thought of as a kind of material or domain, and disputes attempts to provide a \u2018social explanations\u2019 of other states of affairs. While these attempts have been productive (and probably necessary) in the past, the very success of the social sciences mean that they are largely no longer so. At the present stage it is no longer possible to inspect the precise constituents entering the social domain. Latour returns to the original meaning of \u2018the social\u2019 to redefine the notion, and allow it to trace connections again. It will then be possible to resume the traditional goal of the social sciences, but using more refined tools. Drawing on his extensive work examining the \u2018assemblages\u2019 of nature, Latour finds it necessary to scrutinize thoroughly the exact content of what is assembled under the umbrella of Society. This approach, a \u2018sociology of associations\u2019, has become known as Actor-Network-Theory, and this book is an essential introduction both for those seeking to understand Actor-Network Theory, or the ideas of one of its most influential proponents.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Latour__Reassembling_the_Social/Latour__Reassembling_the_Social.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Latour__Reassembling_the_Social/Latour__Reassembling_the_Social.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Latour__Reassembling_the_Social/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Latour__Reassembling_the_Social/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Latour__Reassembling_the_Social/Latour RTS.zip"]},

The aim of the Bauhaus was to find a new and powerful working correlation of all the processes of artistic creation to culminate finally in a new cultural equilibrium of our visual environment. This could not be achieved by individual withdrawal into an ivory tower. Teachers and students as a working community had to become vital participants of the modern world, seeking a new synthesis of art and modern technology. Based on the study of the biological facts of human perception, the phenomena of form and space were investigated in a spirit of unbiased curiosity, to arrive at objective means with which to relate individual creative effort to a common background. One of the fundamental maxims of the Bauhaus was the demand that the teacher\u2019s own approach was never to be imposed on the student; that, on the contrary, any attempt at imitation by the student was to be ruthlessly suppressed. The stimulation received from the teacher was only to help him find his own bearings.This book gives evidence of the Bauhaus approach in the specific field of stage work. Here Oskar Schlemmer played a unique role within the community of the Bauhaus. When he joined the staff in 1921, he first headed the sculpture workshop. But step by step, out of his own initiative, he broadened the scope of this workshop and developed it into the Bauhaus stage shop, which became a splendid place of learning. I gave this stage shop wider and wider range within the Bauhaus curriculum since it attracted students from all departments and workshops. They became fascinated by the creative attitude of their Master Magician.The most characteristic artistic quality in Oskar Schlemmer\u2019s work is his interpretation of space. From his paintings, as well as from his stage work for ballet and theater, it is apparent that he experienced space not only through mere vision but with the whole body, with the sense of touch of the dancer and the actor.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Schlemmer_Nagy__The_Theater_of_the_Bauhaus/Schlemmer_Nagy__The_Theater_of_the_Bauhaus.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Schlemmer_Nagy__The_Theater_of_the_Bauhaus/Schlemmer_Nagy__The_Theater_of_the_Bauhaus.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Schlemmer_Nagy__The_Theater_of_the_Bauhaus/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Schlemmer_Nagy__The_Theater_of_the_Bauhaus/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Schlemmer_Nagy__The_Theater_of_the_Bauhaus/SchlemmerNagy TTotB.zip"]},

How has he done it? By arguing a simple, almost heretical proposition: Economics is ultimately about good and evil. In The Economics of Good and Evil, Sedlacek radically rethinks his field, challenging our assumptions about the world.

It is considered to be one of the most important works of modernist literature and has been called \u201ca demonstration and summation of the entire movement. According to Declan Kiberd, \u201cBefore Joyce, no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking\u201d.Ulysses chronicles the peripatetic appointments and encounters of Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day, 16 June 1904. Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus, the hero of Homer\u2019s epic poem the Odyssey, and the novel establishes a series of parallels between the poem and the novel, with structural correspondences between the characters and experiences of Leopold Bloom and Odysseus, Molly Bloom and Penelope, and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus, in addition to events and themes of the early 20th-century context of modernism, Dublin, and Ireland\u2019s relationship to Britain. The novel is highly allusive and also imitates the styles of different periods of English literature.Since its publication, the book has attracted controversy and scrutiny, ranging from an obscenity trial in the United States in 1921, to protracted textual \u201cJoyce Wars\u201d. The novel\u2019s stream-of-consciousness technique, careful structuring, and experimental prose\u2014replete with puns, parodies, and allusions\u2014as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour, have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works in history; Joyce fans worldwide now celebrate 16 June as Bloomsday.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Joyce__Ulysses/Joyce__Ulysses.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Joyce__Ulysses/Joyce__Ulysses.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Joyce__Ulysses/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Joyce__Ulysses/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Joyce__Ulysses/Joyce U.zip"]},

In these five lively interviews with sociologist Bruno Latour, this increasingly important cultural figure sheds light on the ideas that inspire his highly original, challenging, and transdisciplinary essays.Serres begins by discussing the intellectual context and historical events\u2013 including the impact of World War II and Hiroshima, which for him marked the beginning of science\u2019s ascendancy over the humanities\u2013that shaped his own philosophical outlook and led him to his lifelong mission of bringing together the texts of the humanities and the conceptual revolutions of modern science. He then confronts the major difficulties encountered by his readers: his methodology, his mathematician\u2019s fondness for \u201cshortcuts\u201d in argument, and his criteria for juxtaposing disparate elements from different epochs and cultures in extraordinary combinations. Finally, he discusses his ethic for the modern age\u2013a time when scientific advances have replaced the natural necessities of disease and disaster with humankind\u2019s frightening new responsibility for vital things formerly beyond its control.In the course of these conversations Serres revisits and illuminates many of his themes: the chaotic nature of knowledge, the need for connections between science and the humanities, the futility of traditional criticism, and what he calls his \u201cphilosophy of prepositions\u201d\u2013an argument for considering prepositions, rather than the conventionally emphasized verbs and substantives, as the linguistic keys to understanding human interactions. For readers familiar with Serres\u2019s works as well as for the uninitiated, Conversations on a Life in Philosophy provides fascinating insights into the mind of this appealing, innovative and ardent thinker.Michel Serres has taught at Clermont-Ferrand, at the University of Paris VIII (Vincennes) and at the Sorbonne. He has served as visiting professor at Johns Hopkins University and has been on the faculty of Stanford University since 1984. Bruno Latour, a philosopher and anthropologist, is Professor of Sociology, L\u2019Ecole Nationale Suprieure des Mines in Paris. He has written several books and numerous articles on the ties between the sciences and the rest of culture and society.\nRoxanne Lapidus is Managing Editor of SubStance: A Review of Theory and Literary Criticism.

Both Hamilton and Hancarville (to whom Hamilton entrusted the preparation of the text) regarded this large collection of vases as providing not only \u2018exquisite Models\u2019 but also a possible basis for tracing the \u2018progress of Painting and Design\u2019 and the \u2018stiles of the different periods in the Art of the Ancients\u2019 (v.I., p. vi, 168). For this reason, although Explanations of the plates are included in Vols. I, II, and the text of Vol. II includes a Discourse Upon Painting and a chapter on the Uses the Ancients made of their Vases, How they are found, and the manner of painting them, Hancarville allows his speculations to range very widely, including in Volume I a history of the Etruscans, their letters and customs and the Tuscan order, and in Vols. III, IV, a history of Greek sculpture to the death of Alexander. Here he adumbrates ideas later expounded in his Recherches sur l\u2019origine, l\u2019esprit et les progres des arts (1785-6), tracing the oscillation in art between concentrated symbol and explicit, sophisticated representation. The plates generally show vase paintings of myths or social subjects, with views of the vases and detailed measurements. One mythological painting shows a nude Silenus \u2013 overpainted as clothed by its previous owner, Passeri (vol. II. pl. 68; cf. G.B.Passeri, Picturae Etruscorum In Vasculis, II, pl.103). An example of a social subject is pl. 74 of vol. II, representing a symposium. An interesting in-text illustration shows a group of vases newly discovered in a tomb (vol. II, p.57). Many plates are coloured by hand (in Vol. I 46 plates; in Vol. II 53 plates). The images were most notably taken up by Josiah Wedgwood, one of whose first-day vases made at his new pottery, \u2018Etruria\u2019, in 1769 carries a design based on plate 129 of Vol. I, and who also reproduced the vase shown in the dedication-plate of Vol.I. Whole rooms drew on these images for their decoration (as at Newtimber Place, Sussex, and Bowood, Wiltshire); and they played a considerable part in fostering the Neoclassical taste for outline drawing and engraving. In 1772 Hamilton\u2019s first collection of vases and antiquities was bought for the British Museum, where one red-figure volute crater is known as the \u2018Hamilton Vase\u2019 (shown in Vol. I. pl. 52-6). For many years Hamilton made gifts to the Royal Academy, including casts of bas-reliefs and Piranesi\u2019s prints of the \u2018Warwick\u2019 vase, but oddly did not donate a copy of this work. Although (unsurprisingly) John Flaxman included it in a list of desiderata of \u2018Books essentially useful in the Arts\u2019 that the RA Council resolved to purchase at a meeting on 23 October 1801 (Council Minutes III, 113-14), there is no evidence of a copy having entered the RA Library until the present incomplete set arrived on 6 August 1835 as part of Prince Hoare\u2019s bequest to the Academy of books and prints from his library in London (see RA Council Minutes VIII, 123-25).Provenance\nThe front loose endpapers of Vols.

It was published in 1916, after Saussure\u2019s death, and is generally regarded as the starting point of structural linguistics, an approach to linguistics that flourished in Europe and the United States in the first half of the 20th century. One of Saussure\u2019s translators, Roy Harris, summarized Saussure\u2019s contribution to linguistics and the study of language in the following way:Language is no longer regarded as peripheral to our grasp of the world we live in, but as central to it. Words are not mere vocal labels or communicational adjuncts superimposed upon an already given order of things. They are collective products of social interaction, essential instruments through which human beings constitute and articulate their world. This typically twentieth-century view of language has profoundly influenced developments throughout the whole range of human sciences. It is particularly marked in linguistics, philosophy, psychology, sociology and anthropology\u201d.Although Saussure was specifically interested in historical linguistics, the Course develops a theory of semiotics that is more generally applicable. A manuscript containing Saussure\u2019s original notes was found in 1996, and later published as Writings in General Linguistics.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Saussure__Course_in_General_Linguistics/Saussure__Course_in_General_Linguistics.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Saussure__Course_in_General_Linguistics/Saussure__Course_in_General_Linguistics.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Saussure__Course_in_General_Linguistics/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Saussure__Course_in_General_Linguistics/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Saussure__Course_in_General_Linguistics/Saussure CiGL.zip"]},

Volume I: The Process of Production of Capital (German: Das Kapital. Erster Band. Buch I: Der Produktionsprocess des Kapitals) is a treatise written in the tradition of classical political economy first published in 1867 by German critical theorist and politically engaged writer Karl Marx. The product of a decade of research and redrafting, the book applies class analysis to capitalism focusing upon production processes, making the capitalist mode of production historically specific. Particularly, the sources and forms of surplus value in the context of explaining the dynamics of capital accumulation characterizing economic development over a long period of time are key themes developed analytically throughout the work.These themes are developed on the basis of the abstract labour theory of value Marx presents differently across three editions in German and one in French. Among scholars, there exists controversy over whether the third German edition should be treated as the source for major English translations when the French translation was in fact Marx\u2019s last version.

Mistrusted by philosophy, forbidden and embraced by religions, manipulated as \u201cspectacle\u201d and proliferated in the media, images never cease to present their multiple aspects, their paradoxes, their flat but receding spaces. What is this power that lies in the depths and recesses of an image\u2015which is always only an impenetrable surface? What secrets are concealed in the ground or in the figures of an image\u2015which never does anything but show just exactly what it is and nothing else? How does the immanence of images open onto their unimaginable others, their imageless origin?In this collection of writings on images and visual art, Jean-Luc Nancy explores such questions through an extraordinary range of references. From Renaissance painting and landscape to photography and video, from the image of Roman death masks to the language of silent film, from Cleopatra to Kant and Heidegger, Nancy pursues a reflection on visuality that goes far beyond the many disciplines with which it intersects. He offers insights into the religious, cultural, political, art historical, and philosophical aspects of the visual relation, treating such vexed problems as the connection between image and violence, the sacred status of images, and, in a profound and important essay, the forbidden representation of the Shoah. In the background of all these investigations lies a preoccupation with finitude, the unsettling forces envisaged by the images that confront us, the limits that bind us to them, the death that stares back at us from their frozen traits and distant intimacies. In these vibrant and complex essays, a central figure in European philosophy continues to work through some of the most important questions of our time.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Nancy__The_Ground_of_the_Image/Nancy__The_Ground_of_the_Image.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Nancy__The_Ground_of_the_Image/Nancy__The_Ground_of_the_Image.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Nancy__The_Ground_of_the_Image/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Nancy__The_Ground_of_the_Image/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Nancy__The_Ground_of_the_Image/Nancy TGI.zip"]},

Enter Nobel Prize winning economist and political theorist F. A. Hayek, whose passionate warning against empowering states with greater economic control, The Road to Serfdom, became an overnight sensation last summer when it was endorsed by Glenn Beck. The book has since sold over 150,000 copies. The latest entry in the University of Chicago Press series of newly edited editions of Hayeks works, The Constitution of Liberty is, like Serfdom, just as relevant to our present moment. The book is considered Hayeks classic statement on the ideals of freedom and liberty, ideals that he believes have guided and must continue to guide the growth of Western civilization. Here Hayek defends the principles of a free society, casting a skeptical eye on the growth of the welfare state and examining the challenges to freedom posed by an ever expanding government as well as its corrosive effect on the creation, preservation, and utilization of knowledge. In opposition to those who call for the state to play a greater role in society, Hayek puts forward a nuanced argument for prudence. Guided by this quality, he elegantly demonstrates that a free market system in a democratic polity under the rule of law and with strong constitutional protections of individual rights represents the best chance for the continuing existence of liberty.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Hayek__The_Constitution_of_Liberty/Hayek__The_Constitution_of_Liberty.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Hayek__The_Constitution_of_Liberty/Hayek__The_Constitution_of_Liberty.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Hayek__The_Constitution_of_Liberty/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Hayek__The_Constitution_of_Liberty/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Hayek__The_Constitution_of_Liberty/Hayek TCL.zip"]},

The term \u201ccomplexity\u201d can be misleading, however, because what makes West\u2019s discoveries so beautiful is that he has found an underlying simplicity that unites the seemingly complex and diverse phenomena of living systems, including our bodies, our cities and our businesses.Fascinated by aging and mortality, West applied the rigor of a physicist to the biological question of why we live as long as we do and no longer. The result was astonishing, and changed science: West found that despite the riotous diversity in mammals, they are all, to a large degree, scaled versions of each other. If you know the size of a mammal, you can use scaling laws to learn everything from how much food it eats per day, what its heart-rate is, how long it will take to mature, its lifespan, and so on. Furthermore, the efficiency of the mammal\u2019s circulatory systems scales up precisely based on weight: if you compare a mouse, a human and an elephant on a logarithmic graph, you find with every doubling of average weight, a species gets 25% more efficient\u2014and lives 25% longer. Fundamentally, he has proven, the issue has to do with the fractal geometry of the networks that supply energy and remove waste from the organism\u2019s body", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_West__Scale_The_Universal_Laws_of_Growth/West__Scale_The_Universal_Laws_of_Growth.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_West__Scale_The_Universal_Laws_of_Growth/West__Scale_The_Universal_Laws_of_Growth.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_West__Scale_The_Universal_Laws_of_Growth/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_West__Scale_The_Universal_Laws_of_Growth/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_West__Scale_The_Universal_Laws_of_Growth/West STULG.zip"]},

Instead of elaborating myths, they tell the truth absolutely contrary to the archaic sense. Once exposed, the single victim mechanism can no longer function as the model for would-be sacrificers.Recognizing that the Vedic tradition also converges on a revelation that discredits sacrifice, mimetic theory locates within sacrifice itself a paradoxical power of quiet reflection that leads, in the long run, to the eclipse of this institution which is violent but nevertheless fundamental to the development of human culture. Far from unduly privileging the Western tradition and awarding it a monopoly on the knowledge and repudiation of blood sacrifice, mimetic analysis recognizes comparable, but never truly identical, traits in the Vedic tradition.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Girard__Sacrifice/Girard__Sacrifice.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Girard__Sacrifice/Girard__Sacrifice.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Girard__Sacrifice/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Girard__Sacrifice/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Girard__Sacrifice/Girard S.zip"]},

It was first published in 1808. The first part of Faust is not divided into acts, but is structured as a sequence of scenes in a variety of settings. After a dedicatory poem and a prelude in the theater, the actual plot begins with a prologue in Heaven, where the Lord challenges Mephistopheles, the Devil, that Mephistopheles cannot lead astray the Lord\u2019s favourite striving scholar, Dr. Faust. We then see Faust in his study, who, disappointed of science with natural means, attempts and fails to gain knowledge of nature and the universe by magical ones. The dejected Faust contemplates suicide, but is held back by the sounds of the beginning Easter celebrations. He joins his assistant Wagner for an Easter walk in the countryside, among the celebrating people, and is followed home by a poodle. Back in the study, the poodle transforms itself into Mephistopheles, who offers Faust a contract: he will do Faust\u2019s bidding on earth, and Faust will do the same for him in hell (if, as Faust adds in an important side clause, Mephisto can get him to be satisfied and to want a moment to last forever). Faust signs in blood, and Mephisto first takes him to Auerbach\u2019s tavern in Leipzig, where the devil plays tricks on some drunken revellers. Having then been transformed into a young man by a witch, Faust encounters Margaret (Gretchen) and she excites his desires. Through a scheme involving jewellery and Gretchen\u2019s neighbour Marthe, Mephisto brings about Faust\u2019s and Gretchen\u2019s liaison.

In this pamphlet, Everyware author Adam Greenfield explores the ways in which this discourse treats the city as an abstraction, misunderstands (or even undermines) the processes that truly do generate meaning and value \u2014 and winds up making many of the same blunders that doomed the High Modernist urban planning of the twentieth century. \u201cAgainst the smart city\u201d provides an intellectual toolkit for those of us interested in resisting this sterile and unappealing vision, and lays important groundwork for the far more fruitful alternatives to come.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Greenfield__Against_the_Smart_City/Greenfield__Against_the_Smart_City.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Greenfield__Against_the_Smart_City/Greenfield__Against_the_Smart_City.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Greenfield__Against_the_Smart_City/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Greenfield__Against_the_Smart_City/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Greenfield__Against_the_Smart_City/Greenfield ATSC.zip"]},

Its profound impact not only on art historians and theorists but also for generations of creative writers and intellectuals is almost unprecedented.

By contrast, the urge to abstraction, as exemplified by Egyptian, Byzantine, primitive, or modern expressionist art, articulates a totally different response to the world: it expresses man\u2019s insecurity. Thus in historical periods of anxiety and uncertainty, man seeks to abstract objects from their unpredictable state and transform them into absolute, transcendental forms. Abstraction and Empathy also has a sociological dimension, in that the urge to create fixed, abstract, and geometric forms is a response to the modern experience of industrialization and the sense that individual identity is threatened by a hostile mass society.

That is no longer the case.In this provocative new book, two leading philosophers examine the remarkable rise of realism in the continental tradition. While exploring the similarities and differences in their own positions, they also consider the work of others and assess rival trends in contemporary philosophy. They begin by discussing the relation between realism and materialism, which DeLanda links closely but which Harman tries to separate. Part Two covers the many different meanings of realism, with the two authors working together to develop an expanded definition of the term. Part Three features a spirited exchange on the respective virtues and drawbacks of DeLanda\u2019s realism of attractors and singularities and Harman\u2019s object-oriented theory. Part Four shifts to the question of the knowability of the real, as the authors discuss whether scientific knowledge does full justice to reality.

But, alongside the transformation of capitalism and the demise of statism, there has been a powerful surge of expressions of collective identity. These challenge globalization on behalf of cultural singularity and control over life and environment.

The fundamental categories of existence, the author shows, are threatened by the combined, contradictory assault of techno-economic forces and transformative social movements, each using the new power of the media to promote their ambitions.

A number of economic practices and organizations emerged in Europe and the United States that embodied alternative values: the value of life over the value of money; the effectiveness of cooperation over cut-throat competition; the social responsibility of corporations and responsible regulation by governments over the short-term speculative strategies that brought the economy to the brink of catastrophe.This book examines the blossoming of innovative new experiments in organizing work and life that emerged in the wake of the financial crisis: cooperatives, barter networks, ethical banking, community currencies, shared time banks, solidarity networks, sharing of goods, non-monetary transactions, etc., experiments that paved the way for the emergence of a sharing economy in all domains of activity oriented toward the satisfaction of human needs. Other innovations included the creation of cryptographic virtual currencies, epitomized by bitcoin, which blended a libertarian, entrepreneurial spirit with information technology to provide an alternative to standard forms of currency. On the basis of a cross-cultural analysis of alternative economic practices, this book develops an important theoretical argument: that the economy, as a human practice, is shaped by culture, and that the diversity of cultures, as revealed in a time of crisis, implies the possibility of different economies depending on the values and power relations that define economic institutions.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Castells__Another_Economy_Is_Possible/Castells__Another_Economy_Is_Possible.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Castells__Another_Economy_Is_Possible/Castells__Another_Economy_Is_Possible.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Castells__Another_Economy_Is_Possible/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Castells__Another_Economy_Is_Possible/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Castells__Another_Economy_Is_Possible/Castells AEP.zip"]},

It challenged the entire edifice of the philosophy and learning of Bacon\u2019s time, and left its mark on all subsequent discussions of scientific method.The New Organon is the second part of Bacon\u2019s larger work, the Great Instauration, which aims to offer a new method of investigating nature, called the Interpretation of Nature. A better use of the mind and the understanding is needed to investigate nature. Bacon suggests an entirely new system of logic, which is based on induction rather than on the syllogism. Induction begins with the facts of nature and works slowly towards general axioms or propositions, by building up tables of comparison. Experiments are to be used to assist the senses in this process.Currently, men\u2019s minds are filled with various foolish and incorrect notions that prevent them from understanding nature properly. Bacon seeks to eradicate these notions, which he calls the idols, which originate in human nature, interaction between people and in the work of various philosophers, particularly Aristotle.Book one consists of Bacon\u2019s scathing attack on current philosophy and on the scientific method. He attacks the syllogistic method, and the various idols that prevent men from investigating Nature in a reasonable way. The lack of attention paid to natural philosophy and the excessive reverence for ancient authors are key reasons why man\u2019s knowledge of nature has progressed so slowly.Book Two is a detailed explanation of Bacon\u2019s method, using various examples. It begins by creating tables of the various instances that meet in the nature to be investigated. After the relevant instances have been presented to the intellect, the task of induction can be carried out. Induction acts by excluding various possibilities, until an affirmative has been achieved. The next stage is the consideration of privileged instances, which assist the process in terms of information or of practice.The final section is a rough draft of the kind of natural history that Bacon argues is essential before any interpretation of nature is possible. The method of the Organon is not viable until a vast amount of information about the natural world has been collected.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Bacon__Novum_Organum/Bacon__Novum_Organum.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Bacon__Novum_Organum/Bacon__Novum_Organum.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Bacon__Novum_Organum/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Bacon__Novum_Organum/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Bacon__Novum_Organum/Bacon NO.zip"]},

Drawing on the mathematical theory of surreal numbers, he develops a unified theory of Number as a particular form of being, an infinite expanse to which our access remains limited.

It disputes the primacy placed on individuals in the design and planning process and instead looks to the larger influences of politics, culture, economics, and globalization to uncover the roots of how our built environment evolves.In these chapters, historians offer their analysis on design as a vehicle for power and as a mediator of social currents. Power is defined through a variety of forms: modernization, obsolescence, technology, capital, ergonomics, biopolitics, and others. The chapters explore the diffusion of power through the establishment of norms and networks that frame human conduct, action, identity, and design. They follow design as it functions through the body, in the home, and at the state and international level.Overall, Aggregate views the intersection of architecture with the human need for what Foucault termed \u201cgovernmentality\u201d\u2014societal rules, structures, repetition, and protocols\u2014as a way to provide security and tame risk.

The material feminists\u2019 ambitious goals of socialized housework and child care meant revolutionizing the American home and creating community services. They raised fundamental questions about the relationship of men, women, and children in industrial society. Hayden analyzes the utopian and pragmatic sources of the feminists\u2019 programs for domestic reorganization and the conflicts over class, race, and gender they encountered. This history of a little-known intellectual tradition challenging patriarchal notions of \u201cwomen\u2019s place\u201d and \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d offers a new interpretation of the history of American feminism and a new interpretation of the history of American housing and urban design. Hayden shows how the material feminists\u2019 political ideology led them to design physical space to create housewives\u2019 cooperatives, kitchenless houses, day-care centers, public kitchens, and community dining halls. In their insistence that women be paid for domestic labor, the material feminists won the support of many suffragists and of novelists such as Edward Bellamy and William Dean Howells, who helped popularize their cause. Ebenezer Howard, Rudolph Schindler, and Lewis Mumford were among the many progressive architects and planners who promoted the reorganization of housing and neighborhoods around the needs of employed women.In reevaluating these early feminist plans for the environmental and economic transformation of American society and in recording the vigorous and many-sided arguments that evolved around the issues they raised, Hayden brings to light basic economic and spacial contradictions which outdated forms of housing and inadequate community services still create for American women and for their families.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Hayden__The_Grand_Domestic_Revolution/Hayden__The_Grand_Domestic_Revolution.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Hayden__The_Grand_Domestic_Revolution/Hayden__The_Grand_Domestic_Revolution.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Hayden__The_Grand_Domestic_Revolution/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Hayden__The_Grand_Domestic_Revolution/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Hayden__The_Grand_Domestic_Revolution/Hayden TGDR.zip"]},

It is based on six lectures Innis delivered at Oxford University in 1948. The series, known as the Beit Lectures, was dedicated to exploring British imperial history. Innis however, decided to undertake a sweeping historical survey of how communications media influence the rise and fall of empires. He traced the effects of media such as stone, clay, papyrus, parchment and paper from ancient to modern times.Innis argued that the \u201cbias\u201d of each medium either toward space or toward time helps determine the nature of the civilization in which that medium dominates. \u201cMedia that emphasize time are those that are durable in character such as parchment, clay and stone,\u201d he writes in his introduction. These media tend to favour decentralization. \u201cMedia that emphasize space are apt to be less durable and light in character, such as papyrus and paper.\u201d These media generally favour large, centralized administrations. Innis believed that to persist in time and to occupy space, empires needed to strike a balance between time-biased and space-biased media. Such a balance is likely to be threatened however, when monopolies of knowledge exist favouring some media over others.Empire and Communications examines the impact of media such as stone, clay, papyrus and the alphabet on the empires of Egypt and Babylonia. It also looks at the oral tradition in ancient Greece; the written tradition and the Roman Empire; the influence of parchment and paper in medieval Europe and the effects of paper and the printing press in modern times.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Adams__Empire_and_Communications/Adams__Empire_and_Communications.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Adams__Empire_and_Communications/Adams__Empire_and_Communications.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Adams__Empire_and_Communications/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Adams__Empire_and_Communications/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Adams__Empire_and_Communications/Adams EaC.zip"]},

World-famous above all for his uniquely powerful works of sculpture, he was also a virtuoso architect and draughtsman, a competent painter, a pioneering caricaturist, and a designer of medals, gorgeous fountains and exuberant, lavish ornaments of every sort. He even wrote plays. In fact, he was the latter day epitome of the Renaissance ideal of the uomo universale. Bernini virtually created Baroque Rome \u2013 without his immense and varied contributions, the Eternal City as we know it today would not exist. We would not see the sculpted ecstasy of St Teresa, the embracing arms of the colonnade around the Piazza San Pietro, or the vigorous dramas of the figures on his Fountain of the Four Rivers in Piazza Navona.

This book is a testament to the great genius of the Baroque.

The book was published posthumously in 1953. Wittgenstein discusses numerous problems and puzzles in the fields of semantics, logic, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of psychology, philosophy of action, and philosophy of mind, putting forth the view that conceptual confusions surrounding language use are at the root of most philosophical problems. Wittgenstein alleges that the problems are traceable to a set of related assumptions about the nature of language, which themselves presuppose a particular conception of the essence of language. This conception is considered and ultimately rejected for being too general; that is, as an essentialist account of the nature of language it is simply too narrow to be able to account for the variety of things we do with language. This view can be seen to contradict or discard much of what he argued in his earlier work Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921).Philosophical Investigations is highly influential. Within the analytic tradition, the book is considered by many as being one of the most important philosophical works of the 20th century. The book paved the way for the ordinary language philosophy that dominated Oxford philosophy in the middle of the twentieth century and also influenced pragmatism. The work continues to influence contemporary philosophers working in the philosophy of language and mind.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Wittgenstein__Philosophical_Investigations/Wittgenstein__Philosophical_Investigations.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Wittgenstein__Philosophical_Investigations/Wittgenstein__Philosophical_Investigations.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Wittgenstein__Philosophical_Investigations/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Wittgenstein__Philosophical_Investigations/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Wittgenstein__Philosophical_Investigations/Wittgenstein PI.zip"]},

Combining these philosophical inheritances allows him to reinvoke the human subject without referring to classical humanism or announcing the death of the object. His retrospective review of the disciplines of art and architecture, particularly as they have developed since World War II, provokes him to design, draft, and ultimately build a description of Modernism\u2019s lineage of subjectivity.

The very idea of a modern metropolis evokes visions of bustling sidewalks, vital mass transit, and a vibrant, pedestrian-friendly urban core. But in the typical American city, the car is still king and downtown is a place that\u2019s easy to drive to but often not worth arriving at. Making walkability happen is relatively easy and cheap; seeing exactly what needs to be done is the trick. In this essential book, Speck reveals the invisible workings of the city, how simple decisions have cascading effects, and how we can all make the right choices for our communities. Insightful and passionately argued (Maria Popova, Brain Pickings), bursting with sharp observations and real-world examples, giving key insight into what urban planners actually do and how places can and do change, Walkable City lays out a practical, necessary, and eminently achievable vision of how to make our normal American cities great again.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Speck__Walkable_City/Speck__Walkable_City.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Speck__Walkable_City/Speck__Walkable_City.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Speck__Walkable_City/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Speck__Walkable_City/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Speck__Walkable_City/Speck WC.zip"]},

These are the ruins of America, filled with the echoes of the voices and footfalls of our grandparents, or their parents, or our own youth. Where once these structures were teeming with life commuters, workers, vacationers now they are disused and dilapidated.Ghostly Ruins shows the life and death of thirty such structures, from transportation depots, factories, and jails to amusement parks, mansions, hotels, and entire towns. Author Harry Skrdla gives a guided tour of these marvelous structures at their peak of popularity juxtaposed with their current state of haunted decrepitude. Like a seasoned teller of ghost stories, Skrdla\u2019s words and images reveal what lies beyond the gates and beneath the floorboards. There are the infamous Eastern State Penitentiary and Bethlehem Steel factory in Pennsylvania, the Packard Motors Plant and Book-Cadillac Hotel in Detroit, and Philip Johnson\u2019s New York State Pavilion from the 1964/65 World\u2019s Fair. There is the entire town of Centralia, Pennsylvania, where a trash fire set inside an old mine in 1962 morphed into an underground inferno that incinerated the town from underneath; more than forty years later, the subterranean fire still rages. The town is empty now, just as the many other abandoned places in this chronicle. Ghostly Ruins is a record of the souls of yesteryear and a chronicle of America\u2019s haunted past.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Skrdla__Ghostly_Ruins/Skrdla__Ghostly_Ruins.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Skrdla__Ghostly_Ruins/Skrdla__Ghostly_Ruins.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Skrdla__Ghostly_Ruins/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Skrdla__Ghostly_Ruins/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Skrdla__Ghostly_Ruins/Skrdla GR.zip"]},

Do these fantastical boomtowns, where blueprints spring to life overnight on virgin land, represent the dawning of a brave new world? Or is their vaunted newness a mirage?In a captivating blend of history and reportage, Daniel Brook travels to a series of major metropolitan hubs that were once themselves instant cities\u2014 St. Petersburg, Shanghai, and Mumbai\u2014to watch their \u201cdress rehearsals for the twenty-first century.\u201dUnderstanding today\u2019s emerging global order, he argues, requires comprehending the West\u2019s profound and conflicted influence on developing-world cities over the centuries. In 1703, Tsar Peter the Great personally oversaw the construction of a new Russian capital, a \u201cwindow on the West\u201d carefully modeled on Amsterdam, that he believed would wrench Russia into the modern world. In the nineteenth century, Shanghai became the fastest-growing city on earth as it mushroomed into an English-speaking, Western-looking metropolis that just happened to be in the Far East. Meanwhile, Bombay, the cosmopolitan hub of the British Raj, morphed into a tropical London at the hands of its pith-helmeted imperialists.Juxtaposing the stories of the architects and authoritarians, the artists and revolutionaries who seized the reins to transform each of these precociously modern places into avatars of the global future, Brook demonstrates that the drive for modernization was initially conflated with wholesale Westernization. He shows, too, the ambiguous legacy of that emulation\u2014the birth (and rebirth) of Chinese capitalism in Shanghai, the origins of Bollywood in Bombay\u2019s American-style movie palaces, the combustible mix of revolutionary culture and politics that rocked the Russian capital\u2014and how it may be transcended today.A fascinating, vivid look from the past out toward the horizon, A History of Future Cities is both a crucial reminder of globalization\u2019s long march and an inspiring look into the possibilities of our Asian Century.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Brook__A_History_of_Future_Cities/Brook__A_History_of_Future_Cities.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Brook__A_History_of_Future_Cities/Brook__A_History_of_Future_Cities.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Brook__A_History_of_Future_Cities/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Brook__A_History_of_Future_Cities/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Brook__A_History_of_Future_Cities/Brook AHFC.zip"]},

On people, time, politics, ethics, mess: the real world. Architecture, Jeremy Till argues with conviction in this engaging, sometimes pugnacious book, cannot help itself; it is dependent for its very existence on things outside itself. Despite the claims of autonomy, purity, and control that architects like to make about their practice, architecture is buffeted by uncertainty and contingency. Circumstances invariably intervene to upset the architect\u2019s best-laid plans\u2014at every stage in the process, from design through construction to occupancy. Architects, however, tend to deny this, fearing contingency and preferring to pursue perfection. With Architecture Depends, architect and critic Jeremy Till offers a proposal for rescuing architects from themselves: a way to bridge the gap between what architecture actually is and what architects want it to be.

Could architects continue to draw from the classical wellspring? Could these aesthetic principles be augmented by those of the Romanesque or Gothic periods? Could an entirely new and non-historical architecture be forged?H\u00fcbsch\u2019s provocative argument, which insisted that the technical progress and changed living habits of the nineteenth century had once and for all rendered Neoclassical principles antiquated, touched off a lively, two-decade debate among architects, historians, and critics. This controversy led to a new nineteenth-century style and set the stage for the foundation of Modernism in the last decades of the century.Of particular import is Carl B\u00f6tticher\u2019s incisive analysis of the theoretical landscape written in 1846 in which he proffered for the first time the possibility of a new style based solely upon the structural and spatial innovations of iron construction.

The collection was previously published in Russian in 1971.Scope of Total Architecture contains theoretical writings on the nature and \u2018archaeology\u2019 of architecture, its historical context, and its role in the industrial society of the time the book was written. Gropius admits that it was only after the First World War that he was able to formulate the tasks he set for himself as an architect. Those consisted of creating a new set of values that would \u2018generate an integrated expression of thought and feeling for our time.\u2019 \u2018How such a unity might be attained to become the visible pattern for a true democracy,\u2019 he writes in the introduction, \u2018that is the topic of this book.\u2019Contrary to the purely functional and formal approaches popular at the time, Gropius saw architecture as an integral part of life. Apart from theoretical writings, his vision was reflected in dozens of built projects. Gropius received acclaim early in his career, and although\u2014along with Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier\u2014he was regarded as one of the pioneers of modernist architecture, his writings are far from a modernist manifesto and instead call for a humanist and \u2018purely organic\u2019 architecture that would constantly evolve and change its paradigm.Walter Gropius (1883\u20131969) was a German architect, one of the founders of the Bauhaus School. Gropius started his independent practice as an architect in 1910. By the Bauhaus years, he had already designed several buildings that would have a great impact on modernist architecture, including the Fagus shoe factory in Alfeld. He headed the Bauhaus School from it\u2019s opening in Weimar in 1919 until 1928. Beginning in 1926, Gropius was actively involved in mass housing projects and designed T\u00f6rten estate in Dessau (1926\u20131931) and Dammerstock (1928\u20131929). Following the rise of the Nazis in Germany, in 1934 he left the country for England and in 1937 moved to the USA, where he took a teaching job at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. Towards the end of his life, Gropius returned to Berlin, where he designed a complex of nine-storey apartment blocks in Hansaviertel (1957), still considered to be among the greatest examples of late modernism.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Gropius__Scope_of_Total_Architecture/Gropius__Scope_of_Total_Architecture.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Gropius__Scope_of_Total_Architecture/Gropius__Scope_of_Total_Architecture.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Gropius__Scope_of_Total_Architecture/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Gropius__Scope_of_Total_Architecture/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Gropius__Scope_of_Total_Architecture/Gropius STA.zip"]},

This book explores the potential for using thermal qualities asan expressive element in building design.Until quite recently, building technology and design hasfavored high-energy-consuming mechanical methods of neutralizing the thermal environment. It has notresponded to the various ways that people use, remember, and care about the thermal environment andhow they associate their thermal sense with their other senses. The hearth fire, the sauna, theRoman and Japanese baths, and the Islamic garden are discussed as archetypes of thermal delightabout which rituals have developed \u2014 reinforcing bonds of affection and ceremony forged in thethermal experience. Not only is thermal symbolism now obsolete but the modern emphasis on centralheating systems and air conditioning and hermetically sealed buildings has actually damaged ourthermal coping and sensing mechanisms. This book for the solar age could help change all that andopen up for us a new dimension of architectural experience. As the cost of energy continues toskyrocket, alternatives to the use of mechanical force must be developed to meet our thermal needs. A major alternative is the use of passive solar energy, and the book will provide those interestedin solar design with a reservoir of ideas.

As Nouvel prompts Baudrillard to reflect on some of his signature concepts (the virtual, transparency, fatal strategies, oblivion, and seduction, among others), the confrontation between such philosophical concerns and the specificity of architecture gives rise to novel and striking formulations\u2014and a new way of establishing and understanding the connections between the practitioner and the philosopher, the object and the idea.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Baudrillard_Nouvel__The_Singular_Objects_of_Architecture/Baudrillard_Nouvel__The_Singular_Objects_of_Architecture.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Baudrillard_Nouvel__The_Singular_Objects_of_Architecture/Baudrillard_Nouvel__The_Singular_Objects_of_Architecture.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Baudrillard_Nouvel__The_Singular_Objects_of_Architecture/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Baudrillard_Nouvel__The_Singular_Objects_of_Architecture/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Baudrillard_Nouvel__The_Singular_Objects_of_Architecture/Baudrillard Nouvel TSOA.zip"]},

Many of these buildings were razed long ago, and those that remain stand as grim reminders of an often cruel system. For much of the nineteenth century, however, these asylums epitomized the widely held belief among doctors and social reformers that insanity was a curable disease and that environment\u2014architecture in particular\u2014was the most effective means of treatment.In The Architecture of Madness, Carla Yanni tells a compelling story of therapeutic design, from America\u2019s earliest purpose\u2014built institutions for the insane to the asylum construction frenzy in the second half of the century. At the center of Yanni\u2019s inquiry is Dr. Thomas Kirkbride, a Pennsylvania-born Quaker, who in the 1840s devised a novel way to house the mentally diseased that emphasized segregation by severity of illness, ease of treatment and surveillance, and ventilation. After the Civil War, American architects designed Kirkbride-plan hospitals across the country.Before the end of the century, interest in the Kirkbride plan had begun to decline. Many of the asylums had deteriorated into human warehouses, strengthening arguments against the monolithic structures advocated by Kirkbride. At the same time, the medical profession began embracing a more neurological approach to mental disease that considered architecture as largely irrelevant to its treatment.Generously illustrated, The Architecture of Madness is a fresh and original look at the American medical establishment\u2019s century-long preoccupation with therapeutic architecture as a way to cure social ills.Carla Yanni is associate professor of art history at Rutgers University and the author of Nature\u2019s Museums: Victorian Science and the Architecture of Display.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Yanni__The_Architecture_of_Madness/Yanni__The_Architecture_of_Madness.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Yanni__The_Architecture_of_Madness/Yanni__The_Architecture_of_Madness.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Yanni__The_Architecture_of_Madness/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Yanni__The_Architecture_of_Madness/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Yanni__The_Architecture_of_Madness/Yanni TAM.zip"]},

The novel\u2019s protagonist, Howard Roark, is an individualistic young architect who designs modernist buildings and refuses to compromise with an architectural establishment unwilling to accept innovation. Roark embodies what Rand believed to be the ideal man, and his struggle reflects Rand\u2019s belief that individualism is superior to collectivism.Roark is opposed by what he calls \u201csecond-handers\u201d, who value conformity over independence and integrity. These include Roark\u2019s former classmate, Peter Keating, who succeeds by following popular styles, but turns to Roark for help with design problems. Ellsworth Toohey, a socialist architecture critic who uses his influence to promote his political and social agenda, tries to destroy Roark\u2019s career. Tabloid newspaper publisher Gail Wynand seeks to shape popular opinion; he befriends Roark, then betrays him when public opinion turns in a direction he cannot control. The novel\u2019s most controversial character is Roark\u2019s lover, Dominique Francon. She believes that non-conformity has no chance of winning, so she alternates between helping Roark and working to undermine him. Feminist critics have condemned Roark and Dominique\u2019s first sexual encounter, accusing Rand of endorsing rape.Twelve publishers rejected the manuscript before an editor at the Bobbs-Merrill Company risked his job to get it published. Contemporary reviewers\u2019 opinions were polarized. Some praised the novel as a powerful paean to individualism, while others thought it overlong and lacking sympathetic characters. Initial sales were slow, but the book gained a following by word of mouth and became a bestseller. More than 6.5 million copies of The Fountainhead have been sold worldwide and it has been translated into more than 20 languages. The novel attracted a new following for Rand and has enjoyed a lasting influence, especially among architects, American conservatives and right-libertarians.The novel has been adapted into other media several times. An illustrated version was syndicated in newspapers in 1945. Warner Bros. produced a film version in 1949; Rand wrote the screenplay, and Gary Cooper played Roark. Critics panned the film, which did not recoup its budget; several directors and writers have considered developing a new film adaptation. In 2014, Belgian theater director Ivo van Hove created a stage adaptation, which has received mostly positive reviews.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rand__The_Fountainhead/Rand__The_Fountainhead.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rand__The_Fountainhead/Rand__The_Fountainhead.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rand__The_Fountainhead/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rand__The_Fountainhead/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rand__The_Fountainhead/Rand TF.zip"]},

Aureli uses the term absolute not in the conventional sense of \u201cpure,\u201d but to denote something that is resolutely itself after being separated from its other. In the pursuit of the possibility of an absolute architecture, the other is the space of the city, its extensive organization, and its government. Politics is agonism through separation and confrontation; the very condition of architectural form is to separate and be separated. Through its act of separation and being separated, architecture reveals at once the essence of the city and the essence of itself as political form: the city as the composition of (separate) parts. Aureli revisits the work of four architects whose projects were advanced through the making of architectural form but whose concern was the city at large: Andrea Palladio, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, \u00c9tienne Louis-Boull\u00e9e, and Oswald Mathias Ungers. The work of these architects, Aureli argues, addressed the transformations of the modern city and its urban implications through the elaboration of specific and strategic architectural forms. Their projects for the city do not take the form of an overall plan but are expressed as an \u201carchipelago\u201d of site-specific interventions.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Aureli__The_Possibility_of_an_Absolute_Architecture/Aureli__The_Possibility_of_an_Absolute_Architecture.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Aureli__The_Possibility_of_an_Absolute_Architecture/Aureli__The_Possibility_of_an_Absolute_Architecture.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Aureli__The_Possibility_of_an_Absolute_Architecture/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Aureli__The_Possibility_of_an_Absolute_Architecture/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Aureli__The_Possibility_of_an_Absolute_Architecture/Aureli TPAA.zip"]},

Indeed, it had to be: upon its publication, the chemical industry utilised all its resources to attempt to discredit both Silent Spring and Carson herself \u2013 to no avail.The central argument of the book is that the indiscriminate use of pesticides encouraged by post-war advances in agriculture and chemistry was deeply harmful to plants, animals and the whole environment, with devastating effects that went far beyond protecting crops. At the time, the argument directly contradicted government policy and scientific orthodoxy \u2013 and many studies that corroborated Carson\u2019s views were deliberately suppressed by hostile business interests.

His Minimum Dwelling, originally published in Czech in 1932, and appearing now for the first time in English, is one of the landmark architectural books of the twentieth century. The Minimum Dwelling is not just a book on architecture, but also a blueprint for a new way of living. It calls for a radical rethinking of domestic space and of the role of modern architecture in the planning, design, and construction of new dwelling types for the proletariat. Teige shows how Gropius, Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, and others designed little more than new versions of baroque palaces, mainly for the new financial aristocracy. Teige envisioned the minimum dwelling not as a reduced version of a bourgeois apartment or rural cottage, but as a wholly new dwelling type built on the cooperation of architects, sociologists, economists, health officials, physicians, social workers, politicians, and trade unionists. The book covers many subjects that are still of great relevance. Of particular interest are Teige\u2019s rejection of traditional notions of the kitchen as the core of family-centered plans and of marriage as the foundation of modern cohabitation. He describes alternative lifestyles and new ways of cohabitation of sexes, generations, and classes. The detailed programmatic chapters on collective housing remain far ahead of current thinking, and his comments on collective dwelling presage communal living experiments of the 1960s and 1970s, as well as the communal facilities in contemporary condominium buildings and retirement communities.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Teige__The_Minimum_Dwelling/Teige__The_Minimum_Dwelling.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Teige__The_Minimum_Dwelling/Teige__The_Minimum_Dwelling.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Teige__The_Minimum_Dwelling/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Teige__The_Minimum_Dwelling/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Teige__The_Minimum_Dwelling/Teige tmD.zip"]},

It popularized the term global village, which refers to the idea that mass communication allows a village-like mindset to apply to the entire world; and Gutenberg Galaxy, which we may regard today to refer to the accumulated body of recorded works of human art and knowledge, especially books.McLuhan studies the emergence of what he calls Gutenberg Man, the subject produced by the change of consciousness wrought by the advent of the printed book. Apropos of his axiom, \u201cThe medium is the message,\u201d McLuhan argues that technologies are not simply inventions which people employ but are the means by which people are re-invented. The invention of movable type was the decisive moment in the change from a culture in which all the senses partook of a common interplay to a tyranny of the visual. He also argued that the development of the printing press led to the creation of nationalism, dualism, domination of rationalism, automatisation of scientific research, uniformation and standardisation of culture and alienation of individuals.Movable type, with its ability to reproduce texts accurately and swiftly, extended the drive toward homogeneity and repeatability already in evidence in the emergence of perspectival art and the exigencies of the single \u201cpoint of view\u201d. He writes:The world of visual perspective is one of unified and homogeneous space. Such a world is alien to the resonating diversity of spoken words.

He suggests that the medium affects the society in which it plays a role mainly by the characteristics of the medium rather than the content. The book is considered a pioneering study in media theory.McLuhan pointed to the light bulb as an example. A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that \u201ca light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence.\u201dMore controversially, he postulated that content had little effect on society\u2014in other words, it did not matter if television broadcasts children\u2019s shows or violent programming, to illustrate one example\u2014the effect of television on society would be identical.[citation needed] He noted that all media have characteristics that engage the viewer in different ways; for instance, a passage in a book could be reread at will, but a movie had to be screened again in its entirety to study any individual part of it.The book is the source of the well-known phrase \u201cThe medium is the message\u201d.

This question is becoming increasingly urgent to answer as we face diminishing fossil-fuel resources and the effects of a changing climate while global cities continue to compete to be the most vibrant centers of culture, knowledge, and finance.Jan Gehl has been examining this question since the 1960s, when few urban designers or planners were thinking about designing cities for people. But given the unpredictable, complex and ephemeral nature of life in cities, how can we best design public infrastructure\u2014vital to cities for getting from place to place, or staying in place\u2014for human use? Studying city life and understanding the factors that encourage or discourage use is the key to designing inviting public space.In How to Study Public Life Jan Gehl and Birgitte Svarre draw from their combined experience of over 50 years to provide a history of public-life study as well as methods and tools necessary to recapture city life as an important planning dimension.This type of systematic study began in earnest in the 1960s, when several researchers and journalists on different continents criticized urban planning for having forgotten life in the city. City life studies provide knowledge about human behavior in the built environment in an attempt to put it on an equal footing with knowledge about urban elements such as buildings and transport systems. Studies can be used as input in the decision-making process,  as part of overall planning, or in designing individual projects such as streets, squares or parks.

Journeying through time and place, from the ancient Egyptian pyramids to the soaring skyscrapers of Manhattan, renowned architectural historian Dan Cruickshank explores the most impressive and characterful creations in world architecture. His selection includes many of the world\u2019s best-known buildings that represent key or pioneering moments in architectural history, such as the Pantheon in Rome, Hagia Sophia in Turkey, the Taj Mahal in India and the Forbidden City in China. But the book also covers less obvious and more surprising structures, the generally unsung heroes of an endlessly fascinating story. Buildings like Oriel Chambers in Liverpool and the Narkomfin Apartment Building in Moscow. Dan Cruickshank has visited nearly all the buildings in the book, many in locations that are now inaccessible and under serious threat.

It offers a unique \u2018notebook\u2019 of architectural strategies to present an engaging introduction to elements and concepts in architectural design. Beautifully illustrated throughout with the author\u2019s original drawings, examples are drawn from across the world and many periods of architectural history (from prehistoric times to the recent past) to illustrate analytical themes and to show how drawing can be used to study architecture. Since its first edition appeared in 1997, Analysing Architecture has established itself internationally as one of the key texts in architectural education.In Analysing Architecture, Simon Unwin clearly identifies the key elements of architecture and conceptual themes apparent in buildings and relevant to other works of architecture such as gardens and cities. He describes ideas for use in the active process of design. Breaking down the grammar of architecture into themes and \u2018moves\u2019, Unwin exposes its underlying patterns to reveal the organizational strategies that lie beneath the superficial appearances of buildings.Exploring buildings as results of the interaction of people with the world around them, Analysing Architecture offers a definition of architecture as \u2018identification of place\u2019 and provides a greater understanding of architecture as a creative discipline. This book presents a powerful impetus for readers to develop their own capacities for architectural design. It will also be of use to all those with an interest in the human occupation of and involvement with space \u2013 anthropologists, archaeologists, film-makers, installation artists, planners, urban designers, politicians.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Unwin__Analysing_Architecture/Unwin__Analysing_Architecture.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Unwin__Analysing_Architecture/Unwin__Analysing_Architecture.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Unwin__Analysing_Architecture/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Unwin__Analysing_Architecture/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Unwin__Analysing_Architecture/Unwin AA.zip"]},

He began to raise his literary treasures barely fourteen years old. After embracing the ecclesiastical state, he first taught philosophy at St. Charles College of Avignon.He then resigned in 1767 the cure of Moll\u00e9g\u00e8s which he had been provided, and came to live in Paris. The following year he became librarian of the Duke de la Valliere, a position he held until the death of the Duke in 1780, who bequeathed him 6000 pounds. Although he increased the library which he had charge of with large number of rare and valuable books, he did not participate in drafting the catalog of the collection for the duchess of Ch\u00e2tillon, heir to the Duke of La Valliere commissioned Debure and Vanpraet to catalog the rare books of the library. This preference offended Rive who revenged himself by bitter criticisms against the two scientists. His pride and his irascible and annoying nature quarreled with those caring like him of bibliography, and whom he stigmatized with insulting epithets, to the point that his career was punctuated by continual disputes and debates, even if he was said to have been, in his interior, good parent and friend, and excellent master.When the Marquis de M\u00e9janes bequeathed a considerable library to the \u00c9tats de Provence [fr], the archbishop of Aix proposed, on behalf of his fellow Proven\u00e7aux, that abbot Rive be the librarian of the biblioth\u00e8que M\u00e9janes. Rive accepted this post, but his exorbitant claims gave rise to endless disputes, that his presence at Aix, where he had returned, made even more difficult to close. Meanwhile, the R\u00e9volution broke out and put an end to this project.Abbot Rive then founded in the Proven\u00e7al capital, the faction of the Fr\u00e8res Anti-Politiques (Anti-Political Brethren), gathering little people who were sowing terror. Their misdeeds lead to the riots of December 1790 in Aix-en-Provence [fr] in which was notably murdered lawyer Jean Pierre Joseph Pascalis [fr], of which Rive was even accused of causing death.

A trip to Naples in the company of Jacques-Louis David sparked his interest in Greek and Roman architecture.He was involved in the troubles of the French Revolution. He was a royalist in the Legislative Assembly of 1791-2, and his politics were monarchist and Catholic. As a member of the Revolutionary Committee of Public Instruction his set of three Considerations on the arts of design in France was offered before the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale at a time (1791) when the continuation of the former academies was under question; he offered a program for their reform. in part by opening up the Paris salons. In 1791-92 he orchestrated the conversion of the Church of Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve in Paris (under the direction of Jean-Baptiste Rondelet) into the Panth\u00e9on, infilling the windows to give it the character of a mausoleum. In 1795 he was accused of taking part in the preparations for the royalist insurrection of 13 vend\u00e9miaire and condemned to death, but acquitted in time.In July 1796, Quatremere wrote a pseudo-epistolary treatise against the French plans to seize works of art from Rome, arguing that European powers should instead contribute a sum to the papacy for protecting art and knowledge. Shortly afterward, he was behind a petition signed by forty-seven Parisian artists including Jacques-Louis David which questioned the benefits of displacing art from Rome; although prudently worded, there was a vituperative official response.In the same year he was elected to the Council of Five Hundred from the Seine department, then went into hiding after taking part in a royalist coup; in exile in Germany, he read Immanuel Kant and Gotthold Lessing, whose philosophy informed his own theories of aesthetics. In 1800, back in Paris, he was appointed secretary general of the Seine council. From 1816 until 1839 he was perpetual secretary to the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts, which gave him great influence upon official architecture, and in 1818 he became a professor of archaeology at the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale. He briefly returned to politics in 1820.Quatrem\u00e8re de Quincy was the author of numerous articles and books. From 1788 to 1825, he wrote the three Architecture volumes of the Encyclop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique. His Dictionnaire historique de l\u2019Architecture was published in 1832-33. He wrote biographies of several artists: Antonio Canova (1823), Raphael (1824) and Michelangelo (1835).Quatrem\u00e8re de Quincy transformed the simple metaphor of architecture as language into a framework for reconceptualizing the structure of architecture; modern writers describing \u201cvernacular\u201d architecture, or the Baroque \u201cidiom\u201d or the \u201cvocabulary\u201d of Classicism owe a debt to Quatrem\u00e8re de QuincyHis essay De l\u2019Architecture \u00c9gyptienne, written for a competition posed by the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1785 and published in 1803, just as the Description de l\u2019Egypte was in preparation, nevertheless was an important influence on the Egyptian Revival phase of Neoclassical architecture, for its theoretical observations concerning the origins of architecture rather than for its historical naivet\u00e9. He was among the first to point out the use of polychromy in Greek sculpture and architecture. Though he insisted that landscape gardening could not be admitted among the fine arts, he was a key figure in the establishment of the first landscaped cemeteries, and his essay, translated into English as The Nature, the End and the Means of Imitation in the Fine Arts influenced J. C. Loudon.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/_f_Quincy__Le_Jupiter_olympien_ou_l_art_de_la_sculpture_considere_sous_un_nouveau_point_de_vue/Quincy__Le_Jupiter_olympien_ou_l_art_de_la_sculpture_considere_sous_un_nouveau_point_de_vue.pdf"]},

Questa pubblicazione era intesa come parte di un pi\u00f9 vasto ed articolato progetto che era stato concepito grazie all\u2019iniziativacarletti dell\u2019editore ed antiquario romano Ludovico Mirri. Sua intenzione era quella di restituire alla storia e all\u2019umanit\u00e0 ci\u00f2 che il tempo aveva loro sottratto: presso la vigna Lauretti-Ceci in via Labicana, sul colle Esquilino, erano state rinvenute alcune grandi stanze dipinte che, pur appartenendo al grande complesso della Domus Aurea neroniana, da tempo erano state associate alle soprastanti Terme di Tito. Sui soffitti e sulla fascia pi\u00f9 alta delle pareti sono ancora visibili certe aperture goffamente scavate, corrispondenti proprio a queste prime vie di penetrazione utilizzate dal Mirri nel 1775, il quale avrebbe fatto liberare, a partire da questa data, sedici stanze.Mirri volle rendere noti gli esiti della campagna di scavo condotta nell\u2019area dell\u2019Esquilino, documentandone la ricchezza: i lavori e le indagini ivi operate si concretizzarono nel 1776, con la pubblicazione di una raccolta di incisioni tratte dalle pitture antiche che erano state riportate alla luce nel corso degli scavi, accompagnate da relative schede di commento introdotte da un saggio inedito.

His mother, Marthe-Marguerite de Villette de Mursay, comtesse de Caylus (1673\u20131729), was the daughter of vice-admiral Philippe, Marquis de Villette-Mursay. His younger brother was Charles de Tubi\u00e8res de Caylus, who became a naval officer and governor o Martinique.He was a cousin of Mme de Maintenon, who brought Marthe-Marguerite up like her own daughter. Marthe-Marguerite wrote valuable Souvenirs of the court of Louis XIV; these were edited by Voltaire (1770), and by many later editors.While a young man, Caylus distinguished himself in the campaigns of the French army, from 1709 to 1714. After the peace of Rastatt (1714) he spent some time in travelling in Italy, Greece, the Levant, England and Germany, and devoted much attention to the study and collection of antiquities. He became an active member of the Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture and of the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions. Chief among his antiquarian works must be the profusely illustrated Recueil d\u2019antiquit\u00e9s \u00e9gyptiennes, \u00e9trusques, grecques, romaines et gauloises (6 vols., Paris, 1752-1755), which was mined by the designers of Neoclassical arts for the rest of the century. His Numismata Aurea Imperatorum Romanorum, treats only the gold coinage of the Roman emperors, those worthy of collection by a grand seigneur. His concentration on the object itself marked a step towards modern connoisseuship, and in his M\u00e9moire (1755) on the method of encaustic painting, the ancient technique of painting with wax as a medium mentioned by Pliny the Elder, he claimed to have rediscovered the method. Diderot, who was no friend to Caylus, maintained that the proper method had been found by J.-B. Bachelier.Caylus was an admirable etcher, and copied many paintings of the great masters. He caused engravings to be made, at his own expense, of Bartoli\u2019s copies from ancient pictures and published Nouveaux sujets de peinture et de sculpture (1755) and Tableaux tir\u00e9s de l\u2019Iliade, de l\u2019Odyss\u00e9e, et de l\u2019En\u00e9ide (1757).His cultural interests were not confined to the arts of Classical Antiquity but extended to Gallic monuments, such as the megaliths of Aurille (Poitou), of which he commissioned drawings in 1762.He encouraged artists whose reputations were still in the making, and befriended the connoisseur and collector of prints and drawings Pierre-Jean Mariette when Mariette was only twenty-two, but his patronage was somewhat capricious. Diderot expressed this fact in an epigram in his Salon of 1765: \u201cLa mort nous a d\u00e9livr\u00e9 du plus cruel des amateurs.\u201d Caylus had quite another side to his character. He had a thorough acquaintance with the gayest and most disreputable sides of Parisian life, and left a number of more or less witty stories dealing with it. These were collected (Amsterdam, 1787) as his \u0152uvres badines compl\u00e8tes. The best of them is the Histoire de M. Guillaume, cocher (c. 1730).His Contes, hovering between French fairy tales and oriental fantasies, between conventional charm and moral satire, have been collected and were published in 2005; they were originally published as les F\u00e9eries nouvelles (1741), les Contes orientaux (1743), Cinq contes de f\u00e9es (1745), plus two posthumous stories published in 1775.The Souvenirs du comte de Caylus, published in 1805, is of very doubtful authenticity. See also E. and J. de Goncourt, Portraits intimes du XVIIIi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle; Charles Nisard\u2019s edition of the Correspondance du comte de Caylus avec le p\u00e8re Paciaudi (1877); and a notice by O.

Una volta rientrati a Cortona, furono loro i fondatori della Societ\u00e0 per la compra dei libri, nel 1726.

Insieme a Carlo arrivavano a Napoli anche le casse della collezione Farnese da Parma. Un primo riordino degli oggetti delle collezioni fu commissionato a Marcello Venuti che lo condusse con grande capacit\u00e0 e che gli valse la nomina, nel 1734, a direttore della Galleria Farnese di Napoli. Nel frattempo egli promosse e partecip\u00f2 alle prime scoperte delle antichit\u00e0 nascoste sotto la citt\u00e0 di Ercolano, che gli portarono, come riconoscimento l\u2019ambito titolo di marchese di Cuma.Nel 1740, Marcello Venuti, deluso dalle risposte che le sue scoperte avevano suscitato a Napoli, decise che era il momento di tornarsene a Cortona, anche perch\u00e9 era necessario che qualcuno della famiglia si dedicasse alla sistemazione degli affari domestici. Prese cos\u00ec in moglie Lucrezia Venuti, figlia di Piero e di Maddalena Vermiglioli, discendente di un altro ramo dei Venuti e da lei ebbe sei figli, tre maschie e tre femmine.

In 1747 he undertook a journey to Vienna, in company with the bishop of Volterra, for whom he acted in the capacity of secretary. He was introduced to the emperor and took the opportunity of dedicating to that monarch his Specimen Litteraturae Florentinae, which was then printed at Florence. On his return he took holy orders, and settled in Rome, passing the whole of his time in the library of the Vatican, and in those of the cardinals Passionei and Corsini.The famous obelisk of Augustus, at that time removed from the ruins of Campus Martius, was described by Bandini in a learned folio volume entitled De Obelisco Augusti. Shortly after, he was compelled to leave Rome on account of his health and returned to Florence, where he was appointed librarian to the valuable Biblioteca Marucelliana bequeathed to the public by the abbott Marucelli. In 1756 he was assigned by the emperor to a prebend at Florence, and appointed principal librarian to the Laurentian Library.

His mother, Marthe-Marguerite de Villette de Mursay, comtesse de Caylus (1673\u20131729), was the daughter of vice-admiral Philippe, Marquis de Villette-Mursay. His younger brother was Charles de Tubi\u00e8res de Caylus, who became a naval officer and governor o Martinique.He was a cousin of Mme de Maintenon, who brought Marthe-Marguerite up like her own daughter. Marthe-Marguerite wrote valuable Souvenirs of the court of Louis XIV; these were edited by Voltaire (1770), and by many later editors.While a young man, Caylus distinguished himself in the campaigns of the French army, from 1709 to 1714. After the peace of Rastatt (1714) he spent some time in travelling in Italy, Greece, the Levant, England and Germany, and devoted much attention to the study and collection of antiquities. He became an active member of the Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture and of the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions. Chief among his antiquarian works must be the profusely illustrated Recueil d\u2019antiquit\u00e9s \u00e9gyptiennes, \u00e9trusques, grecques, romaines et gauloises (6 vols., Paris, 1752-1755),[a] which was mined by the designers of Neoclassical arts for the rest of the century.[citation needed] His Numismata Aurea Imperatorum Romanorum, treats only the gold coinage of the Roman emperors, those worthy of collection by a grand seigneur. His concentration on the object itself marked a step towards modern connoisseuship, and in his M\u00e9moire (1755) on the method of encaustic painting, the ancient technique of painting with wax as a medium mentioned by Pliny the Elder, he claimed to have rediscovered the method. Diderot, who was no friend to Caylus, maintained that the proper method had been found by J.-B. Bachelier.Caylus was an admirable etcher, and copied many paintings of the great masters. He caused engravings to be made, at his own expense, of Bartoli\u2019s copies from ancient pictures and published Nouveaux sujets de peinture et de sculpture (1755) and Tableaux tir\u00e9s de l\u2019Iliade, de l\u2019Odyss\u00e9e, et de l\u2019En\u00e9ide (1757).His cultural interests were not confined to the arts of Classical Antiquity but extended to Gallic monuments, such as the megaliths of Aurille (Poitou), of which he commissioned drawings in 1762.[citation needed]He encouraged artists whose reputations were still in the making, and befriended the connoisseur and collector of prints and drawings Pierre-Jean Mariette when Mariette was only twenty-two, but his patronage was somewhat capricious. Diderot expressed this fact in an epigram in his Salon of 1765: \u201cLa mort nous a d\u00e9livr\u00e9 du plus cruel des amateurs.\u201d[b] Caylus had quite another side to his character. He had a thorough acquaintance with the gayest and most disreputable sides of Parisian life, and left a number of more or less witty stories dealing with it. These were collected (Amsterdam, 1787) as his \u0152uvres badines compl\u00e8tes. The best of them is the Histoire de M. Guillaume, cocher (c. 1730). His Contes, hovering between French fairy tales and oriental fantasies, between conventional charm and moral satire, have been collected and were published in 2005; they were originally published as les F\u00e9eries nouvelles (1741), les Contes orientaux (1743), Cinq contes de f\u00e9es (1745), plus two posthumous stories published in 1775.The Souvenirs du comte de Caylus, published in 1805, is of very doubtful authenticity.

Maffei was the son of Paolo Maffei and his wife Giovanna di Raffaele, both of patrician families of Volterra. He was a descendant of the humanist and papal bureaucrat Raffaele Maffei, \u201cil Volterrano,\u201d (1451\u20131522), author of the Commentaria urbana (1506), dedicated to Julius II. Paolo Alessandro was made a cavaliere of the Tuscan Order of Saint Stephen and an honorary member of the Papal Guard. He wrote the laudatory biography of Pope Pius V, in which he praised the Pope\u2019s suppression of newsletters and slanderous printed avvisi in 1572.Maffei\u2019s name is familiar to art historians today because, when the entrepreneurial printer-publisher Domenico de\u2019 Rossi published a collection of engravings of ancient and modern Roman sculpture, Raccolta di statue antiche e moderne (Rome, 1704), he turned to the well-known antiquarian for suitably learned descriptive text, for what was in effect the first eighteenth-century art book, whose refined engravings by French artists were designed to appeal to the cognoscenti. The lavish folio volumes concentrated on the best-known ancient sculptures, with a handful of modern ones in prominent collections, and some antiquities that were interesting to the enlightened amateur largely for their attributed subject matter. The arrangement of the plates by collection demonstrated that the most admired Roman sculptures, aside from the pre-eminent collection in the Cortile del Belvedere, had come to rest in four great family collections: Farnese, Medici, Borghese and Ludovici, and, as Haskell and Penny have noted, no recent excavations had added new examples to the established canon of Roman antiquities.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/_i_Maffei_Rossi__Gemme_antiche_figurate/Maffei_Rossi__Gemme_antiche_figurate.pdf"]},

Nel 1723 Thomas Coke inizi\u00f2 finalmente la pubblicazione di un\u2019edizione ampliata dell\u2019opera. Il manoscritto originale si trova custodito nella biblioteca di Coke a Holkham Hall.Oltre a essere un\u2019ottima fonte storica sulla popolazione etrusca, diede inizio alla corrente culturale detta Etruscheria, variamente giudicata e apprezzata, che diede impulso allo sviluppo delle conoscenze in ambito storico relative agli Etruschi.Il testo ebbe nel 1724 una edizione in Italia a cura di Filippo Buonarroti.Thomas Dempster (23 August 1579 \u2013 6 September 1625) was a Scottish scholar and historian. Born into the aristocracy in Aberdeenshire, which comprises regions of both the Scottish highlands and the Scottish lowlands, he was sent abroad as a youth for his education. The Dempsters were Catholic in an increasingly Protestant country and had a reputation for being quarrelsome. Thomas\u2019 brother James, outlawed for an attack on his father, spent some years as a pirate in the northern islands, escaped by volunteering for military service in the Low Countries and was drawn and quartered there for insubordination. Thomas\u2019 father lost the family fortune in clan feuding and was beheaded for forgery.For these and political and religious reasons in these often violent Elizabethan times Thomas was unable to come home except for visits. Of uncommon and impressive height and intellectual ability he became an itinerant professor in France and Italy, driven from place to place by a series of colourful personal incidents in which he fought duels or opposed officers of the law. He eventually found refuge and patronage under Grand Duke Cosimo II of Tuscany, who commissioned a work on the Etruscans. Three years later Thomas handed the duke a magnum opus, the manuscript of De Etruria Regali Libri Septem, \u201cSeven Books about Royal Etruria\u201d, in the Latin language, the first detailed study of every aspect of Etruscan civilisation, considered a brilliant work. In 1723 Thomas Coke finally undertook to publish an enhanced edition of it. The original manuscript remains in Coke\u2019s library at Holkham.", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Dempster", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/_l_Dempster_Buonarroti__De_Etruria_regali/Dempster_Buonarroti__De_Etruria_regali.pdf"]},

In 1709, with the blessings of his father, a successful artist who became Mayor (German: B\u00fcrgermeister) of K\u00fcstrin, Stosch began a tour of Holland, France, and England, which eventually led him to Italy. In Rome, a letter of introduction brought him into the circle of Pope Clement XI, a collector and connoisseur of antiquities. Soon he developed a close friendship with the cardinal-nephew, Alessandro Albani. Called home with the death of his elder brother in 1717, Stosch began a series of broader European journeys.Once again in Rome, Stosch became a dealer in art and antiquities at the center of the antiquarian group that were commissioning excavations in search of works of art. Above all he was a collector of engraved gems of antiquity, books and manuscripts, early engravings and drawings and reputedly a connoisseur of Roman men (reference to his homosexuality). He financed his passions by some unorthodox means, including spying on the Jacobite court in Rome for Sir Robert Walpole\u2019s British Government. Stosch was unmasked as a clandestine operative in 1731, and his life was threatened. He was forced to flee the Papal States and took refuge in Florence, under the tolerant rule of Grand Duke Gian Gastone de\u2019 Medici. There he settled into a long retirement devoted to connoisseurship, pensioned by the British until he died in 1757. Before long his growing collection required a separate house of its own. (ref. Datenbank Altertumswissenschaften)Stosch was a founder of a Masonic Lodge in Florence in 1733, that became a direct concern of Rome, leading to the ban on Catholics becoming Freemasons. The first papal ban of Freemasonry, issued by the Florentine-born Pope Clement XII, was not based on any ideological objection to Freemasonry, as is often supposed. In the wake of the 1738 bull Clement\u2019s cardinal-nephew Neri Corsini, wrote stressing that Freemasonry in England was merely an innocent amusement;[citation needed] the main objection, according to Corsini, was that the lodge in Florence had become \u201ccorrupt\u201d. His house became a center for spiritual inquiry of a Rosicrucian, alchemical-panphilosophical nature. The lodge was closed and Tommaso Crudeli was imprisoned.He encouraged young German artists, not merely those who illustrated his own works but others, like Johann Lorenz Natter (1705-1763), a German gem-engraver and medalist whom Stosch set to copying ancient carved gems in Florence and whose Masonic medal commemorating the Mastership of Charles Sackville, 1733, was engraved and widely distributed (ref. Pelizzi). Versions of it exist in gold and in silver; the Grand Duke apparently got a silver one, now at the Bargello.Stosch is credited with making the monocle fashionable, but as a connoisseur, Stosch made his lasting impression with a great volume on the subject of Gemm\u00e6 Antiqu\u00e6 C\u00e6lat\u00e6 (Pierres antiques grave\u00e9s) (1724), in which Bernard Picart\u2019s engravings reproduced seventy antique carved hardstones like onyx, jasper and carnelian from European collections, a volume of inestimable value to antiquarians and historians. It immediately joined the repertory of books of engravings after antiquities of all kinds, which were an essential part of eighteenth century classical studies and informed the Neoclassical styles that got under way shortly after Stosch\u2019s death. In English translation by George Ogle it had several editions. At Burton Constable Hall, Yorkshire, the Dining Room overmantel relief executed in the 1760s features Bacchus and Ariadne riding on a panther, modeled on a cameo from the volume. Dozens of other Palladian and Neoclassical uses of the Stosch volume might be instanced.The baron\u2019s own great collection eventually contained over 10,000 cameos, intaglios, and antique glass pastes, the majority of which eventually went to the museums in Berlin. The hardstone carvings among his collections, which rivaled numismatics for their interest to antiquarians, were engraved and entrusted for publication to Winckelmann. Winckelmann\u2019s work was underwritten by Baron von Stosch\u2019s nephew and heir, Heinrich Wilhelm Muzel, another lifelong bachelor, who had come to stay in Florence with Stosch in 1757 and had been adopted and made Philipp von Stosch\u2019s heir (ref. Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Trier) .Thus he was looking for prospective purchasers of his uncle\u2019s collection just at this moment.Winckelmann\u2019s last letter, penned in the Trieste inn the night he was murdered by a young man he had just picked up, was addressed to Muzel-Stosch. In 1765 King Frederick the Great eventually purchased the greatest part of the collection, for 20 or 30,000 Reichsthaler and an annuity of 400 Reichsthaler (refs. Datenbank Altertumswissenschaften, Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Trier); so the engraved gems came to rest in the Berlin museums. Description des Pierres grav\u00e9es provided subjects for the familiar Neoclassical jasperware medallions in low relief, against green or blue grounds, which were produced in great number by Josiah Wedgwood. Individual figures were re-engraved for Gentleman\u2019s Magazine and found their way into Neoclassical marquetry medallions on London-made furniture and other minor decorative arts.Among other elements in the dispersed collections, the Atlas\u2014of 324 volumes\u2014 in which Stosch kept his drawings, among other things the entire cache of drawings left by the Baroque architect Borromini, which Stosch acquired about 1730, before his withdrawal to Florence (ref. Connors), eventually went to Vienna. His considerable library, strong in \u201chistory, politics, diplomacy, conclaves, embassies and relazioni from distant parts\u201d (Connors), was purchased in 1759 for the Vatican Library where it is housed with the then recently purchased Ottoboni library (and bear the shelfmarks Ottob.lat. 2565-3100). One of the codices, containing important musical notation, which had belonged to Queen Christina and was given by her to the Vatican Library, was stolen and appeared in Stosch\u2019s library, when was then sold to the Vatican in 1759 and thus was returned (ref. Ottoboni Lat. 3025).(Particularly valuable early prints found individual purchasers: Stosch\u2019s group of niello prints attributed to Tommaso di Finiguerra were bought by the Leipzig merchant Ernst Peter Otto (1724\u201399), whose celebrated print collection was dispersed in massive sales in 1851-52.Some of his medals were acquired by unconventional means. According to an anecdote related by Isaac d\u2019Israeli,It was in looking over the gems of the royal cabinet of medals, that the keeper perceived the loss of one; his place, his pension, and his reputation were at stake; and he insisted that Baron Stosch should be most minutely examined: in this dilemma, forced to confession, this erudite collector assured the keeper of the royal cabinet, that the strictest search would not avail \u201cAlas, sir! I have it here within,\u201d he said, pointing to his breast. An emetic was suggested by the learned practitioner himself, probably from some former experiment.In 1764 some of his collections were sold at auction, his architectural drawings, strong in sixteenth century architects, went to enrich the Albertina, Vienna. The Codex Stosch, a bound volume of measured drawings of ancient Roman buildings made by the brother of Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, disappeared after the sale. The codex reappeared in 2005 and was purchased for the RIBA Library, London.His profile portrait appears on a medal he commissioned from Fran\u00e7ois Marteau in 1727His widely circulated letters on antiquarian subjects were reassembled in Carl Justi, Antiquarische Briefe des Baron Philipp von Stosch (1871).Baron Von Stosch, after his death in Florence, was inhumed in the Old English Cemetery in Livorno, where his grave, still existing, is badly damaged.", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_von_Stosch", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/_l_Stosch__Gemmae_ antiquae_caelatae_sculptorum_nominibus_insignitae_delineatae_et_aeri_incisae/Stosch__Gemmae_ antiquae_caelatae_sculptorum_nominibus_insignitae_delineatae_et_aeri_incisae.pdf"]},

M\u00e4rz 1763 in Rom) war ein italienischer Antiquar, Arch\u00e4ologe, Numismatiker und Kunsthistoriker. Er gilt als einer der bedeutendsten Antiquare seiner Zeit und machte sich vor allem mit seinen bebilderten Katalogen r\u00f6mischer arch\u00e4ologischer Sammlungen einen Namen. Venuti war von 1744 bis zu seinem Tod p\u00e4pstlicher Antiquar und Aufseher \u00fcber die Antikensammlungen und Ausgrabungen des Kirchenstaates.Ridolfino Venuti stammte aus einer alteingesessenen, angesehenen Familie aus Cortona. Er schlug eine Karriere als Geistlicher ein und begann ein Studium verschiedener Sprachen, insbesondere Latein, Altgriechisch und Hebr\u00e4isch, aber auch Englisch und Franz\u00f6sisch in Prato und an der Universit\u00e4t Pisa. Am 29. Dezember 1726 geh\u00f6rte er mit seinem Bruder Niccol\u00f2 Marcello zu den elf Gr\u00fcndungsmitgliedern der Accademia Etrusca, einer internationalen Gelehrtenorganisation, die sich vorrangig, aber nicht nur der Erforschung der Etrusker und anderer antiker Kulturen verschrieben hatte und die bis heute existiert. 1734 ging er in den Dienst des Kardinals Alessandro Albani nach Rom. \u00dcber diesen und seinen Kunst sammelnden Onkel Onofrio Baldelli lernte er in Rom viele Gelehrte, K\u00fcnstler und Reisende kennen. Zu seinem Umkreis geh\u00f6rten Philipp von Stosch, Francesco Valesio, Francesco Bianchini und Francesco de Ficoroni. Als Fremdenf\u00fchrer f\u00fchrte er viele bedeutende G\u00e4ste durch Rom und seine Ruinen. Venuti hatte Zugang zu allen bedeutenden Sammlungen der Stadt Rom. Neben den Vatikanischen Sammlungen und der seines Arbeitgebers Albani waren darunter bedeutende private Sammlungen wie die Sammlungen Capponi, Mattei und Odescalchi. Schnell hatte er sich einen vorz\u00fcglichen Ruf als Kenner der Antike erarbeitet, woraufhin ihn Papst Benedikt XIV. an die 1740 neu gegr\u00fcndete Accademia di storia Romana e d\u2019antichit\u00e0 profane berief. 1742 begr\u00fcndete er das Giornale di letterati mit, in dem in internationaler Ausrichtung wissenschaftliche Neuigkeiten er\u00f6rtert wurden. 1744 wurde er in der Nachfolge Francesco Palazzis zum Commissario delle Antichit\u00e0 und damit zum Oberaufseher \u00fcber die antiken Monumente und die p\u00e4pstlichen Sammlungen der Stadt, \u00fcber die Ausgrabungen und den Verkauf von Antiken ernannt. Die fast 20 Jahre in dieser Funktion nutzte Venuti, um die r\u00f6mischen Monumente und Sammlungen systematisch zu erfassen, aufzuarbeiten und zu dokumentieren. Nachfolger im Amt wurde Johann Joachim Winckelmann. 1748 wurde Venuti mit der Arbeit Dissertazione sopra due antiche greche iscrizioni promoviert. Seine hohe Wertsch\u00e4tzung \u00fcber die nationalen Grenzen hinaus zeigte sich in seiner Berufung zum associ\u00e9 libre der Acad\u00e9mie royale des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres im Jahr 1750 und 1757 als Mitglied in die Royal Society.Titelblatt der Accurata e succinta descrizione topografica delle antichita di Roma. (3. Auflage, 1824)\nVenuti bereicherte die Arch\u00e4ologie nicht um neue Theorien zur Arch\u00e4ologie und brachte sie auch nicht mit neuen Interpretationen zu Kunstwerken voran. Aufgrund seines weit gef\u00e4cherten Interesses und seinem Hang zur systematischen Materialerfassung von Monumenten in der Stadt Rom wie auch in den r\u00f6mischen Sammlungen lagen seine arch\u00e4ologischen Verdienste in seinen Werken gro\u00dfer Materialf\u00fclle, die zudem von vielen Abbildungen begleitet wurden. Dadurch haben sie bis heute einen gro\u00dfen dokumentarischen Wert. Auch als Mitbegr\u00fcnder der Akademie von Cortona ist sein Wirken bis heute sp\u00fcrbar. In Venutis Arbeiten lassen sich zwei Richtungen erkennen. Zum einen war er Lokalpatriot und r\u00fchmte in seinen Arbeiten seine Heimat Cortona und seine Wahlheimat Rom. Zum anderen ist bei ihm auch ein beginnender italienischer Nationalismus zu erkennen, indem er etwa das Primat der italienischen vor der franz\u00f6sischen Malerei vertrat. Seine wichtigsten Arbeiten waren bildreiche Kataloge r\u00f6mischer Sammlungen. 1736 publizierte er die gemischte Sammlung Borioni, 1739 die M\u00fcnzen der Sammlung Albani und 1744 die p\u00e4pstlichen numismatischen Sammlungen (Numismata Romanorum Pontificum praestantiora a Martino V. ad Benedictum XIV.). Erst postum wurden die drei B\u00e4nde zu den Skulpturen der Sammlung Mattei ver\u00f6ffentlicht. 1750 verfasste er mit Antonio Francesco Gori einen Katalog des Museums von Cortona, was die in der Entstehung befindliche Etruskologie stark befl\u00fcgeln sollte. Ein F\u00fchrer zu den Kapitolinischen Museen richtete sich vorrangig an die nicht wissenschaftlichen Besucher.

He was a descendant of the humanist and papal bureaucrat Raffaele Maffei, \u201cil Volterrano,\u201d (1451\u20131522), author of the Commentaria urbana (1506), dedicated to Julius II.

The lavish folio volumes concentrated on the best-known ancient sculptures, with a handful of modern ones in prominent collections, and some antiquities that were interesting to the enlightened amateur largely for their attributed subject matter. The arrangement of the plates by collection demonstrated that the most admired Roman sculptures, aside from the pre-eminent collection in the Cortile del Belvedere, had come to rest in four great family collections: Farnese, Medici, Borghese and Ludovici, and, as Haskell and Penny have noted, no recent excavations had added new examples to the established canon of Roman antiquities.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/_i_Maffei_Rossi__Raccolta_di_Statue_Antiche_e_Moderne/Maffei_Rossi__Raccolta_di_Statue_Antiche_e_Moderne.pdf"]},

His Lives of the Artists (Vite de\u2019Pittori, Scultori et Architetti Moderni), published in 1672, was influential in consolidating and promoting the theoretical case for classical idealism in art. As an art historical biographer, he favoured classicising artists rather than Baroque artists to the extent of omitting some of the key artistic figures of 17th-century art altogether.Bellori, possibly the nephew of the antiquarian collector and writer Francesco Angeloni, lived in Angeloni\u2019s home in Rome. As a young man, he apparently took art lessons from the painter Domenichino and became a member of the Accademia di San Luca, the painting academy in Rome.Bellori was curator of antiquities for Pope Clement X. In 1671, he was appointed secretary of the Accademia di San Luca. He was later appointed as librarian and antiquarian to Queen Christina of Sweden. He died in 1696 in Rome and was buried in the Church of S. Isidoro.In 1664 Bellori delivered an influential speech to the Accademia on the Ideal in Art. In 1672 he published this as a preface to his biographies of recent and contemporary artists, entitled: Le vite de\u2019 pittori, scultori et architetti moderni (The lives of the modern painters, sculptors, and architects).Bellori\u2019s Lives of the Artists covers the brothers Annibale Carracci and Agostino Carracci, Domenico Fontana, Federico Barocci, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Francois Duquesnoy, Domenico Zampieri (il Domenichino), Giovanni Lanfranco, Alessandro Algardi and Nicholas Poussin. He planned a work on Bolognese artists, but, only completed entries for Guido Reni, Andrea Sacchi and Carlo Maratta.In Bellori\u2019s view, the Renaissance ideal had been rescued from the tangled post-Raphael and Michelangelo styles now known as Mannerism, by the robust classicism of those following Annibale Carracci\u2019s lead. Bellori advocated idealism over realism or naturalism. This famously led to Bellori\u2019s reverence of the painting of Annibale Carracci and repudiation of Caravaggio. His writing of the \u2018Idea\u2019 is influenced by Giovanni Battista Agucchi, Vasari, Leon Battista Alberti, Aristotle and others. In Bellori\u2019s Lives the artists he most admired were Domenichino and Nicolas Poussin; his friend the sculptor Alessandro Algardi was praised while Bernini was not mentioned and he included the painters Andrea Sacchi and his pupil Carlo Maratta, however, he omitted Pietro da Cortona. Bellori often relied for his facts on the earlier biographies of Roman artists by Giovanni Baglione.Vasari\u2019s definition of disegno or design, at that time seen as the most important artistic element, is tied up in the concept of \u2018prudence\u2019. An artist\u2019s work could essentially be seen as a series of choices, and the wisdom of these choices was owed to the character or \u2018prudence\u2019 of the artist. This forms the basis of subsequent value judgments in art by Bellori and his contemporaries. Bellori and Agucchi, after Aristotle, equated the practice of idealism with prudent choice, and naturalism with poor prudence.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/_l_Bellori__Veteres_arcus_Augustorum_triumphis_insignes/Bellori__Veteres_arcus_Augustorum_triumphis_insignes.pdf"]},

He completed his studies under Daniel Heinsius at Leiden, and among others under the Protestant theologian David Blondel at Amsterdam.During his residence in Amsterdam, under Blondel\u2019s influence he abandoned Lutheranism and joined the Reformed Church; and in 1656 he was called by the Elector of Brandenburg to the chair of rhetoric in the University of Duisburg. Two years afterwards, on the recommendation of Gronovius, he was chosen to succeed that scholar at Deventer; in 1662 he moved to the University of Utrecht, where he occupied first the chair of rhetoric, and in addition, from 1667 until his death, that of history and politics.Thesaurus antiquitatum et historiarum Italiae, 1704\nGraevius enjoyed a very high reputation as a teacher, and his lecture-room was crowded by pupils, many of them of distinguished rank, from all parts of the world. He was visited by Lorenzo Magalotti and honoured with special recognition by Louis XIV, and was a particular favourite of William III of England, who made him historiographer royal.His two most important works are the Thesaurus antiquitatum Romanarum (1694\u20131699, in 12 volumes), and the Thesaurus antiquitatum et historiarum Italiae published after his death, and continued by the elder Pieter Burmann (1704\u20131725), although these have not always been looked upon favourably.[1] His editions of the classics, although they marked a distinct advance in scholarship, are now for the most part superseded.

He worked for the curia of three popes, including being camiere d\u2019honore of Clement XI, and secretary of the commission for the reform of the calendar, working on the method to calculate the astronomically correct date for Easter in a given year.\nBianchini was born of a noble family at Verona, the son of Giuseppe Bianchini and his wife, Cornelia Vailetti. In 1684 he went to Rome, and became librarian to Cardinal Ottoboni, who, as Pope Alexander VIII (1689), raised him to the offices of papal chamberlain and canon of Santa Maria Maggiore. Clement XI sent him on a mission to Paris in 1712, and employed him to form a museum of Christian antiquities. A paper by him on Giovanni Domenico Cassini\u2019s new method of parallaxes was inserted in the Acta Eruditorum of Leipzig in 1685.He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in January 1713 after being proposed by Sir Isaac Newton.A gnomon in the south wall of the Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri projects the sun\u2019s image onto Bianchini\u2019s line every solar noon\nHis deduction of the rotational period of Venus was based on the observation of its surface using a 2.6\u2033 (66mm) 100-foot focal length aerial telescope. Today, we know that this is impossible, because of the thick cloud cover on this planet. He also worked on the parallax of Venus, and he measured the precession of the Earth\u2019s rotational axis.As part of his efforts to improve the accuracy of the calendar, Bianchini was commissioned by Pope Clement XI to construct an important meridian line in the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri (the Basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels and the Martyrs) in Rome, a device for calculating the position of the sun and stars.\nAccording to a Catholic News Service online news story by Carol Glatz from 5 August 2011, Pope Benedict XVI noted this when he explained the importance of astronomy- especially when clocks were primitive and prone to error- in the determination of certain liturgical celebration days and the times for certain daily prayers, such as the Angelus.His point of view on the Copernican system is not evident, but it was noted that the picture of the planetary system in his book about Venus has an empty centre. Craters on Mars and the Moon are named in his honour. He also worked as a topographer and archaeologist of ancient Rome, and as a collector.In 1726, near the Via Appia, a structure consisting of three sepulchral chambers of some of the servants and freedmen of Augustus and his wife Livia were discovered and excavated. Bianchini explored these rooms and published a description. One day in 1727, while exploring the ruins of the palace of the Cesar\u2019s, on the Palatine Hill, he fell through the ceiling of a vault and was severely injured.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/_i_Bianchini__La_istoria_universale_provata_con_monumenti_e_figurata_con_simboli_de_gli_antichi/Bianchini__La_istoria_universale_provata_con_monumenti_e_figurata_con_simboli_de_gli_antichi.pdf"]},

Following medical studies at Strasbourg, the younger Spon first met the son of a friend of his father, Charles Patin, who introduced him to antiquarian interests and the study of numismatics, then as now a window into the world of Classical Antiquity. In Paris, Jacob Spon lodged with Patin\u2019s father, Guy Patin. At Montpellier he received his doctorate in medicine (1668) and subsequently practiced in Lyon to a wealthy clientele. There his first publication appeared, a Recherche des antiquit\u00e9s et curiosit\u00e9s de la ville de Lyon and he entered into correspondence with a wider circle of savants: the abb\u00e9 Claude Nicaise at Dijon, du Cange at Paris, the erudite circles that gravitated to le Grand Dauphin and the duc d\u2019Aumont. Among his correspondents were the courtier-theologian Jacques-B\u00e9nigne Bossuet, the philosopher Pierre Bayle, Pierre Carcavy, the Jesuit scholar Fran\u00e7ois d\u2019Aix de la Chaise, confessor to the King, and Fran\u00e7ois Charpentier. He met Jean Mabillon when Mabillon passed through Lyon in 1682.Spon travelled to Italy, and then to Greece, to Constantinople and the Levant in 1675\u20131676 in the company of the English connoisseur and botanist Sir George Wheler (1650\u20131723), whose collection of antiquities was afterwards bequeathed to Oxford University. They were among the first knowledgeable Western European antiquaries to see the antiquities of Greece at first hand. Spon\u2019s Voyage d\u2019Italie, de Dalmatie, de Gr\u00e8ce et du Levant (1678) remained a useful reference work even in the time of Chateaubriand, who employed it in his trip to the East.Spon brought back many valuable treasures, coins, inscriptions and manuscripts. In January 1680, he quarreled with P\u00e8re de La Chaise, who pressed him to convert to Catholicism. That year Spon published his Histoire de la r\u00e9publique de Gen\u00e8ve, followed by his R\u00e9cherches curieuses d\u2019antiquit\u00e9 (Lyon 1683) and in 1685 a collection of transcriptions of Roman inscriptions gleaned over the years, Miscellanea eruditae antiquitatis, in the preface to which he offered one of the earliest definitions of \u201carchaeologia\u201d to describe the study of antiquities in which he was engaged.In 1681 Spon published a brief (95pp.) treatise on fevers, which, being well-received, he expanded to 264 pp. to include the latest remedies, including \u201cQuinquina\u201d from \u201cPerou,\u201d which he considers especially effective, but which, he says, the \u201cAmeriquains\u201d did not recognize: \u201cle quinquina n\u2019etoit pas connu pour la guerison des fievres par les Ameriquains meme\u2026\u201d. \u201cObservations sur les Fievres et les Febrifuges\u201d was published by Thomas Amaulry at Lyon in 1684 and posthumously in 1687.

Rather than abjure his Calvinist faith he preferred to leave for Zurich, an illegal move. His money and baggage stolen from him, and in fragile health, he died of tuberculosis in the canton hospital at Vevey, Christmas Day 1685, at the age of 38.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/f_Spon__Recherches_curieuses_d_antiquite/Spon__Recherches_curieuses_d_antiquite.pdf"]},

His Lives of the Artists (Vite de\u2019Pittori, Scultori et Architetti Moderni), published in 1672, was influential in consolidating and promoting the theoretical case for classical idealism in art. As an art historical biographer, he favoured classicising artists rather than Baroque artists to the extent of omitting some of the key artistic figures of 17th-century art altogether. Bellori, possibly the nephew of the antiquarian collector and writer Francesco Angeloni, lived in Angeloni\u2019s home in Rome. As a young man, he apparently took art lessons from the painter Domenichino and became a member of the Accademia di San Luca, the painting academy in Rome.Bellori was curator of antiquities for Pope Clement X. In 1671, he was appointed secretary of the Accademia di San Luca. He was later appointed as librarian and antiquarian to Queen Christina of Sweden. He died in 1696 in Rome and was buried in the Church of S. Isidoro.\nIn 1664 Bellori delivered an influential speech to the Accademia on the Ideal in Art. In 1672 he published this as a preface to his biographies of recent and contemporary artists, entitled: Le vite de\u2019 pittori, scultori et architetti moderni (The lives of the modern painters, sculptors, and architects).Bellori\u2019s Lives of the Artists covers the brothers Annibale Carracci and Agostino Carracci, Domenico Fontana, Federico Barocci, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Francois Duquesnoy, Domenico Zampieri (il Domenichino), Giovanni Lanfranco, Alessandro Algardi and Nicholas Poussin. He planned a work on Bolognese artists, but, only completed entries for Guido Reni, Andrea Sacchi and Carlo Maratta. In Bellori\u2019s view, the Renaissance ideal had been rescued from the tangled post-Raphael and Michelangelo styles now known as Mannerism, by the robust classicism of those following Annibale Carracci\u2019s lead. Bellori advocated idealism over realism or naturalism. This famously led to Bellori\u2019s reverence of the painting of Annibale Carracci and repudiation of Caravaggio. His writing of the \u2018Idea\u2019 is influenced by Giovanni Battista Agucchi, Vasari, Leon Battista Alberti, Aristotle and others. In Bellori\u2019s Lives the artists he most admired were Domenichino and Nicolas Poussin; his friend the sculptor Alessandro Algardi was praised while Bernini was not mentioned and he included the painters Andrea Sacchi and his pupil Carlo Maratta, however, he omitted Pietro da Cortona. Bellori often relied for his facts on the earlier biographies of Roman artists by Giovanni Baglione.Vasari\u2019s definition of disegno or design, at that time seen as the most important artistic element, is tied up in the concept of \u2018prudence\u2019. An artist\u2019s work could essentially be seen as a series of choices, and the wisdom of these choices was owed to the character or \u2018prudence\u2019 of the artist. This forms the basis of subsequent value judgments in art by Bellori and his contemporaries. Bellori and Agucchi, after Aristotle, equated the practice of idealism with prudent choice, and naturalism with poor prudence.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/_l_Bellori__Veterum_Illustrium_Philosophorum/Bellori__Veterum_Illustrium_Philosophorum.pdf"]},

His sympathies inclined to Low Churchism in religion and to Whiggism in politics.Prideaux gained the patronage of Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham, as tutor to his son Charles, and in 1677 he obtained the sinecure rectory of Llandewy-Velfrey, Pembrokeshire. In 1679 Finch presented him to the rectory of St Clement\u2019s, Oxford, which he held till 1696. He was appointed also, in 1679, Busby\u2019s Hebrew lecturer in Christ Church College. Finch gave him in 1681 a canonry at Norwich, and Sir Francis North in February 1683 presented him to the rectory of Bladon, Oxfordshire, which included the chapelry of Woodstock. He retained his studentship at Christ Church, where he was acting as unsalaried librarian.Prideaux married and left Oxford for Norwich, ahead of James II\u2019s appointment (October 1686) of John Massey, a Roman Catholic, as Dean of Christ Church. He exchanged (1686) Bladon for the rectory of Saham-Toney, Norfolk, which he held till 1694. He engaged in controversy with Roman Catholics, especially on the point of the validity of Anglican orders. As canon of Norwich he improved the financial arrangements of the chapter, and put the records in order. In December 1688 he was made archdeacon of Suffolk by his bishop William Lloyd, an office which he held till 1694. While Lloyd became a nonjuror, Prideaux exerted himself at his archidiaconal visitation (May 1689) to secure the taking of the oaths; out of three hundred parishes in his archdeaconry only three clergymen became nonjurors. At the Convocation which opened on 21 November 1689 Prideaux was an advocate for changes in the Book of Common Prayer, with a view to the comprehension of Dissenters. Subsequently he officially corrected a lax interpretation of the Toleration Act 1688, as though it exempted from the duty of attendance on public worship. Gilbert Burnet consulted him in 1691 about a measure for prevention of pluralities, and Prideaux drafted a bill for this purpose. Richard Kidder consulted him in the same year about a bill for preventing clandestine marriages.From 1689 to 1694 Prideaux resided at Saham. He declined in 1691 the Oxford Hebrew chair vacated by the death of Edward Pococke, a step which he afterwards regretted. Saham did not suit his health, and he returned to Norwich. In a letter written on 28 November 1694 after receiving the news of John Tillotson\u2019s death, he said that he had no expectations of future advancement. Early in 1697 he was presented to the vicarage of Trowse, near Norwich, a chapter living, which he held till 1709. He succeeded Henry Fairfax as dean of Norwich, and was installed on 8 June 1702. On the translation to Ely (31 July 1707) of John Moore, Prideaux recommended the appointment of Charles Trimnell, his fellow canon, as bishop.In 1721 Prideaux gave his collection of oriental books to Clare Hall, Cambridge. From about 1709 he had suffered severely from the stone, which prevented him from preaching. An operation was badly managed; attacks of rheumatism and paralysis reduced his strength. He died on 1 November 1724, at the deanery, Norwich, and was buried in the nave of the Norwich Cathedral, where there was a stone to his memory, with an epitaph composed by himself.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/_l_Prideaux__Marmora_Oxoniensia_Ex_Arundellianis_Seldenianis_aliisque_conflata/Prideaux__Marmora_Oxoniensia_Ex_Arundellianis_Seldenianis_aliisque_conflata.pdf"]},

Appointed superintendent of antiquities in the Papal States by Pope Alexander VII, he directed excavations in Rome at the Forum and at the thermae near the church of San Lorenzo in Panisperna, where he discovered the \u201cBarberini Hera\u201d.In 1649 he issued a new edition of Filippo Paruta\u2019s Sicilian Medals, with engravings of 400 additional specimens. In conjunction with Gian Pietro Bellori (1615\u20131696) he published Gemme antiche figurate, a work on antique engraved gems, in two volumes (Rome, 1657 and 1669); the first was devoted entirely to Cardinal Francesco\u2019s collection, which Agostini had assembled for the papal nephew, and the second to cameos and other discoveries from the auguste ruine della gran Roma (the \u201caugust ruins of great Rome\u201d). The work, which grouped the gems according to the themes represented, was translated into Latin by Jakob Gronovius in Amsterdam, 1685.Agostini was acquainted with all the Roman antiquarians of his day, including Bellori, Cassiano dal Pozzo and Andrea Sacchi; he preserved a volume of Annibale Caracci\u2019s ephemeral caricature sketches.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/_i_Agostini_Bellori__Le_Gemme_antiche_figurate/Agostini_Bellori__Le_Gemme_antiche_figurate.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/_i_Agostini_Bellori__Le_Gemme_antiche_figurate_1680/Agostini_Bellori__Le_Gemme_antiche_figurate_1680.pdf"]},

He married and was ultimately induced, in the hope of employment and honors, to settle in Paris. Both Fouquet and Colbert in their turn recognized his abilities; he was one of the first members (1663) of the Academy of Inscriptions. Three years later Colbert procured him the appointment of court historian to the king, in which one of his commissions was the minute descriptions of court f\u00eates, an essential element of the king\u2019s cultural propaganda.

Ben presto si trasfer\u00ec a Roma, dove \u00e8 documentato dal 1570, e seguendo l\u2019esempio di altri bresciani, anche loro occupati nelle professioni legate al libro, si dedic\u00f2 all\u2019attivit\u00e0 editoriale. A Roma spos\u00f2 Anna Gribbi, pi\u00f9 giovane di lui di tredici anni, che gli sopravvisse. Dal matrimonio nacquero quattro figlie, Felicita, Plautilla, Francesca e Faustina, le ultime due morte in tenera et\u00e0. And\u00f2 a vivere in una casa di sua propriet\u00e0 in via del Pellegrino, nella parrocchia di S. Lorenzo in Damaso, dove si trovavano numerose botteghe di librai e tipografi.Il F. fu l\u2019iniziatore di un\u2019importante attivit\u00e0 editoriale, proseguita nel secolo successivo dagli eredi. La bottega era nella sua stessa casa ed egli fu soprattutto editore e libraio. Il nome del F. \u00e8 attestato a Roma gi\u00e0 nel 1570: il 3 gennaio di quell\u2019anno fu padrino di battesimo del figlio di uno stampatore di nome Giovanni. Nel 1573, il 21 luglio, il suo nome era tra coloro che firmarono una convenzione con il Comune di Roma per la stampa e lo smercio dei libri editi dalla Stamperia del Popolo Romano.La nuova societ\u00e0, che si sottoscriveva Apud Bibliopolas Socios, era composta, oltre che dal F., da Domenico Basa, Giorgio Ferrari, Brianza Brianzi, Marco Amadori, anche lui bresciano, Sebastiano De Franceschi e Antonio Lanza. La societ\u00e0 si sciolse nel 1584, dopo numerose liti e incomprensioni non solo tra i librai e il Popolo Romano, ma anche tra Domenico Basa e gli altri componenti. Lo scioglimento della societ\u00e0 non fu cosa facile e solo nel gennaio del 1584 decadde definitivamente l\u2019accordo preso tra la Stamperia del Popolo Romano e la Compagnia dei Librai. Nell\u2019ultimo anno di collaborazione vennero stampati il Decretum Gratiani, primo volume di un Corpus iuris canonici, e le Decretales di papa Gregorio IX. Il Corpus iuris canonici in cinque volumi veniva stampato nello stesso anno anche a Venezia e nelle note tipografiche si legge: \u201cApud Magnam societatem, una cum Georgio Ferrario et Hieronymo Franzino\u201d. Collabor\u00f2 a questa edizione il tipografo veneziano Giovanni Battista Porta.L\u2019attivit\u00e0 del F. si svolse contemporaneamente a Venezia e a Roma. A Venezia sottoscrisse a partire dal 1582. Il suo nome compare insieme con quello di Giovanni Varisco nell\u2019edizione del Rosario della Vergine Maria di Luis de Granada. La tipografia era di Giovanni Varisco che stamp\u00f2 a Venezia dal 1558 al 1590 e aveva come marca la sirena con due code tenute divaricate, che si attorcigliano sulle braccia. Per questo il F. all\u2019inizio della sua attivit\u00e0 \u00e8 detto \u201clibraro alla Serena\u201d. Egli mantenne costanti rapporti con il Varisco. Infatti nel 1595 il figlio di Giovanni, Giorgio, si trasfer\u00ec a Roma presso la casa e la bottega del F. e mut\u00f2, poi, l\u2019insegna della Sirena con quella della Fontana.Nelle sue edizioni sia veneziane sia romane appare come marca editoriale una fontana zampillante, con otto zampilli nella parte superiore e dodici nella parte inferiore. La sottoscrizione appare variabile: \u201cad Signum Fontis\u201d, \u201call\u2019insegna della Fonte\u201d, \u201cal segno della fonte\u201d o \u201cal segno della fontana\u201d.Il nome del F. \u00e8 spesso affiancato a quello di altri tipografi. Cos\u00ec nel 1588 a Roma stamp\u00f2 con i fratelli Tito e Paolo Diani una raccolta di rime in onore di Sisto V dal titolo Delle glorie di Sisto Quinto, composte da Muzio Pansa. L\u2019attivit\u00e0 del F. si svilupp\u00f2 sostanzialmente su due filoni: quello delle opere di carattere giuridico e religioso e quello delle opere dedicate a Roma e ai suoi monumenti. Al primo filone appartengono le edizioni stampate con la Compagnia dei librai, la gi\u00e0 citata edizione di Luis de Granada, le edizioni del Manuale del Navarro, di Martin de Azpilcueta (1591 e 1594). Nel 1590 stamp\u00f2 a Venezia con Damiano Zenaro una raccolta in tre volumi di decisioni della Rota romana, Decisionum novissimarum diversorum sacri Palatii apostolici auditorum, e ancora nel 1595 a Roma la Praxis beneficiorum del francese Pierre Rebuffi, insieme al tipografo Guglielmo Facciotto. Pi\u00f9 significativo l\u2019altro aspetto della sua attivit\u00e0, ovvero la pubblicazione di opere riguardanti i monumenti e le antichit\u00e0 di Roma. Il F. inizi\u00f2 a pubblicare opere di questo argomento a partire dal 1588, anno in cui Sisto V indisse uno dei quattro anni santi speciali e Roma fu quindi meta di numerosissimi pellegrini. Nel 1588 a Venezia uscirono sotto il nome del F. L\u2019antichit\u00e0 di Roma del romano Andrea Fulvio, con annotazioni e aggiunte di Girolamo Ferrucci. L\u2019opera \u00e8 preceduta da una epistola dedicatoria del F. al nobile bolognese Gaspare dell\u2019Armi. Sempre a Venezia venne pubblicata l\u2019opera di Bartolomeo Marliano, Urbis Romae topographia, anche questa con le aggiunte di Girolamo Ferrucci relative all\u2019attivit\u00e0 urbanistica di Sisto V. Nello stesso anno (1588) a Venezia usc\u00ec l\u2019edizione di Le cose maravigliose dell\u2019alma citt\u00e0 di Roma, illustrata dallo stesso F. e redatta dall\u2019agostiniano Sante Selinori originario di Monte San Savino.L\u2019edizione comprende anche La antichit\u00e0 di Roma di Andrea Palladio. Le incisioni che arricchiscono queste edizioni non hanno un grande valore dal punto di vista artistico, ma sono interessanti, perch\u00e9 durante quasi centotrenta anni sono state costantemente adoperate per illustrare le guide di Roma.Le cose maravigliose costituiscono la prima vera guida di Roma, il cui nucleo originale sub\u00ec modifiche, cambiamenti e aggiunte nelle numerose edizioni che si susseguirono dalla met\u00e0 del sec. XVI in poi. La prima edizione si ebbe a Venezia nel 1541 per i tipi di Guglielmo Da Fontaneto e a questa ne seguirono molte altre. Ma la fortuna editoriale di questa guida si ebbe con il giubileo del 1575. In quell\u2019anno se ne contano ben quattro diverse edizioni. L\u2019edizione veneziana del 1588 venne ristampata dal F. nel 1594 sempre a Venezia e nel 1595 a Roma insieme al tipografo Guglielmo Facciotto. Si ebbero anche edizioni in francese e spagnolo. Nel 1600 sar\u00e0 Giovanni Antonio Franzini, fratello e erede di Girolamo a stampare un\u2019altra edizione di Le cose maravigliose, curata dal romano Prospero Parisio. La prima raccolta completa delle silografie incise dal F. apparve nel 1596. Il volume, citato da Thomas Ashby, \u00e8 composto di quattro parti: Antiquitates Romanae Urbis, Templa Deo et sanctis eius Romae dicata, Palatia procerum Romanae Urbis e Icones statuarum antiquarum Urbis Romae. Un\u2019altra edizione di queste silografie si ebbe nel 1599 a Roma e nelle note tipografiche compare ancora il nome del F. (\u201cHieronymi Franzini bibliopolae ad Signum Fontis\u201d) nonostante egli fosse gi\u00e0 morto da alcuni anni.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/_l_Franzini__Icones_Statuarum_antiquarum_Urbis_Romae/Franzini__Icones_Statuarum_antiquarum_Urbis_Romae.pdf"]},

This period, now called the High Renaissance, is generally considered to be one of the high points of Western civilisation. How did it come about, and what were the forces that converged to spark such an explosion of creative activity? In this study, Ingrid Rowland examines the culture, society, and intellectual norms that generated the High Renaissance. This interdisciplinary 2001 study assesses the intellectual paradigm shift that occurred at the turn of the fifteenth century. It also finds and explains the connections between ideas, people, and the art works they created by looking at economics, art, contemporary understanding of classical antiquity, and social conventions.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rowland__The_Culture_of_the_High_Renaissance/Rowland__The_Culture_of_the_High_Renaissance.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rowland__The_Culture_of_the_High_Renaissance/Rowland__The_Culture_of_the_High_Renaissance.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rowland__The_Culture_of_the_High_Renaissance/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rowland__The_Culture_of_the_High_Renaissance/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rowland__The_Culture_of_the_High_Renaissance/Rowland TCotHR.zip"]},

A student of Ammanati, with whom he realized the Villa dell\u2019Ambrogiana, Dosio worked primarily in Rome (1548\u201375) and Florence (1575\u201389), with some commissions that took him to Naples.During his early years in Rome, where he arrived at the age of fifteen, Dosio produced numerous drawings of the ancient and modern city, and developed a reputation as an antiquary while he was still a young man. He worked in the atelier of Raffaello da Montelupo until 1551. His first important Roman commission was the tomb for his friend, the humanist poet Annibale Caro, in 1567; in the interim, he scratched out a miserable living doing restorations of fragments of Roman sculpture. In 1562 he was carrying out an excavation on behalf of the papal condottiere Torquato Conti, who had extensive contacts among humanist and antiquarian circles in Rome and knew Dosio\u2019s good friend Annibale Caro. Dosio was uncovering the fragments of the marble map of Rome made for Septimius Severus, the Forma Urbis Romae from a site near the Church of SS Cosma e Damiano.In 1564 a papal courier found Dosio in the Umbrian hilltown of Amelia, working on a funeral monument for a local bishop, Bartolomeo Farrattino. Immediately thereafter Dosio left to oversee the rebuilding of fortifications at Anagni, his first work as an architect, which was interrupted in 1565 with the death of Pope Pius IV; of this work, two of the rusticated portals remain, the Porta S. Maria, and the Porta S. Francesco. The overall design of the fortifications was doubtless due to Pius\u2019s cousin, Gabrio Serbelloni, and the military governor, Torquato Conti, to whom Dosio owed the commission. He was the author of Urbis aedificiorum illustrium quae supersunt reliquiae (1569). Giovanni Battista Caccini was his pupil.His place in the history of the period, according to modern art scholar Carolyn Valone (1976) is of the \u201csecond rank\u201d. From 1590 he worked for almost twenty years in Naples, where the Viceroy bestowed on him the prestigious appointment of \u201croyal architect\u201d. In Naples he realized the cloister of the San Martino Charterhouse, worked on a draft for the Girolamini church, while in the Cathedral of Naples he realized the Brancaccio Chapel (1598). From 1600 He worked in Caserta for the Prince of Caserta Andrea Matteo Acquaviva D\u2019Aragona.

A unique unfinished version of the book, sent by the Habsburg court antiquarian, Carl Gustaf Heraeus, to the Tessin family of architects and collectors in Stockholm in 1720, provides some insight into these difficult problems. This copy demonstrates that much of the work was still unfinished even in the last months before publication. A number of the plates were evidently not yet prepared, and others, which had been engraved years earlier, were still awaiting revision. The Tessins\u2019 copy also bears conflicting dates of 1710 and 1712, suggesting that the work was perhaps to have been published about a decade before it became available. Although it is possible that there was a small earlier edition, it seems likely that this was never produced. Furthermore, the incomplete book sent to the Tessins facilitates a substantial revision to our understanding of the development of the work, particularly in regard to the collaboration of Fischer and Heraeus, as well as illustrating the rather close link between the courts in Stockholm and Vienna.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/_g_Von_Erlach__Entwurff_einer_historischen_Architectur/Von_Erlach__Entwurff_einer_historischen_Architectur.pdf"]},

In 1755 he published the second edition with a famous, often reproduced illustration of a primitive hut. His approach is to discuss some familiar aspects of Renaissance and post-Renaissance architectural practice, which he describes as \u2018faults\u2019. These \u2018faults\u2019 induce his commentary on columns, the entablature, and on pediments. Among faults he lists for columns are that of \u201cbeing engaged in the wall\u201d, the use of pilasters, incorrect entasis (swelling of the column), and setting columns on pedestals. Being embedded in the wall detracts from the overall beauty and aesthetic nature of columns; Laugier states that columns should be free. He goes on to assert that the use of pilasters should strictly be frowned upon especially since in nearly every case columns could be used instead. The second fault is created by incorrect proportion, and the last he believes is more of an unintelligible design. Resting columns on pedestals, he says, is like adding a second set of legs beneath the first pair. The Essai sur l\u2019Architecture includes his thoughts on several other topics, ranging from solidity, the different orders, and how to construct different buildings.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/f_Laugier__Essai_sur_l_architecture/Laugier__Essai_sur_l_architecture.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/f_Laugier__Essai_sur_l_architecture/Laugier__Essai_sur_l_architecture.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/f_Laugier__Essai_sur_l_architecture/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/f_Laugier__Essai_sur_l_architecture/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/f_Laugier__Essai_sur_l_architecture/Laugier Esl.zip"]},

Philippe de La Hire, for example, used it as the basis for his conferences at the Acad\u00e9mie for over two years, from July 1696 to October 1698, as did subsequent professors throughout the eighteenth century. Its universal ambition, its emphasis on \u201ccorrectness\u201d, and its method of classification according to design problems became defining qualities of a specifically French model of architectural theory.

According to Klein and Zerner, it is \u201ca superficial and rather poor piece of writing\u201d of dubious factual value, but it stands out as a monument of artistic spirit, pride and self-consciousness of Florentine people.

Against this background, it traces a subtle but revolutionary change that occurred in European architecture and which aroused issues that still echo in the debates between architectural traditionalists and modernists and between modernists and postmodernists.Rykwert\u2019s study goes well beyond the tradition of architectural history, which has largely been concerned with the outward, stylistic evolution from the classic to the Baroque and Rococo. It examines buildings as embodiments of the whole culture, founded on basic philosophical concepts and shaped by ongoing political and religious upheavals. In particular, it focuses on the shift from the \u201cclassic\u201d to the \u201cNeoclassic.\u201dThe study includes major painters and sculptors of the period and pays considerable attention to the practical and social context in which the architects, artists, and artisans worked\u2014the organization of labor, the establishment of the Academies and of the architectural profession, the development of the building guilds, and the rise of freemasonry.

Let us simply say that in spite of Vitruvius\u2019 apparently precise instructions, Perrault was very aware of the random or arbitrary character of the Latin theoretician\u2019s \u201cr\u00e8gles\u201d in defining a \u201cbeaut\u00e9 positive\u201d, all the more so since objective criteria, solidity, salubrity and convenience are more important to him than exact proportions. At the same time, Desgodet\u2019s measurements published in 1682 in his Edifices antiques de Rome underline the absence of coincidence, already painfully noted as early as Bramante\u2019s period, but here declared in the clearest and the most solid way, between the precepts of De architectura and the proportions observable in the vestiges at all levels of the plans and elevations.All of this created the most bitter polemics among the Academicians.\nIn any case, Perrault\u2019s work had great good fortune; abridged editions came out very quickly in Paris (1674), Amsterdam (1681), London (1692, 1703, 1729), Venice (1711, 1747, 1794) and Madrid (1761). They were responding to an obvious demand; the translation would be transposed into almost every European language, and presented in a handier form, as a real practitioner\u2019s manual.

In this book David R. Coffin, one of America\u2019s leading experts on Renaissance architecture and landscape architecture, mobilizes all available published and unpublished materials to offer the first comprehensive account of Ligorio\u2019s life and multifaceted career.Coffin traces the unfolding of Ligorio\u2019s life from his early years in Naples, to his work in Rome, where he served several popes and pored over Ancient ruins, through his residency in Ferrara as court antiquarian. In addition to illuminating Ligorio\u2019s relationship to his patrons, Coffin sheds new light on Ligorio\u2019s famed map of ancient Rome, a masterpiece that bears witness to Ligorio\u2019s cartographic skills, his erudition, and his lifelong fascination with the eternal city. Copiously illustrated, Coffin\u2019s biography includes a checklist of Ligorio\u2019s drawings. It will be of interest to architectural historians, art historians, and all those involved with the study of Rome and of the classical heritage.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Coffin__Pirro_Ligorio/Coffin__Pirro_Ligorio.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Coffin__Pirro_Ligorio/Coffin__Pirro_Ligorio.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Coffin__Pirro_Ligorio/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Coffin__Pirro_Ligorio/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Coffin__Pirro_Ligorio/Coffin PL.zip"]},

Cette cons\u00e9cration du nouveau pouvoir \u00e9tait en m\u00eame temps celle d\u2019une nouvelle culture : mise en sc\u00e8ne par Jean Martin, humaniste et grand traducteur, la c\u00e9r\u00e9monie faisait intervenir l\u2019\u00e9lite des jeunes po\u00e8tes de la Pl\u00e9iade en m\u00eame temps qu\u2019une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de sculpteurs et d\u2019architectes pleine d\u2019avenir. Avec Ronsard et du Bellay, la po\u00e9sie s\u2019y exprimait avec une grandeur neuve ; quant \u00e0 l\u2019architecture, elle prenait une dimension encore in\u00e9dite, et les Jean Goujon, Pierre Lescot ou Philibert De L\u2019Orme, rejoints par Jean Bullant et Jacques Androuet du Cerceau, auraient pu former une \u201d brigade \u201d en tout point comparable \u00e0 celle des po\u00e8tes.

It remained unknown until its \u2018discovery\u2019 in March 2015 and its presentation in the Burlington Magazine in November 2016. The work had escaped the radar of the art historians because of a series of accidental circumstances. The bust was not finished in time to be mentioned in the sculptor\u2019s Notizie, the original manuscripts of which are conserved in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze. These notes, completed in 1691 under the watchful eye of Guidi (a former student of Alessandro Algardi), are now the main point of departure for modern research on the artist. The bust was probably moved from Rome immediately after its completion, and was never seen, nor even mentioned by Lione Pascoli, who published a biography of the sculptor in 1730. Destined for a literary academy situated within a private palace in Urbino, the bust was not even highlighted in the burgeoning guides to the Marche in 18th and 19th centuries. It represented a cardinal who would become pope in 1700, just eight years after its completion. But this meant that within eight years the bust was already iconographically \u2018wrong\u2019, in that this cardinal\u2019s portrait was unsuitable for the new celebrity Urbino would confer upon its fellow citizen, Clement XI, throughout his pontificate. But above all, over the centuries the bust has become a work that is simply \u2018out of context\u2019: an exemplar of late 17th-century Roman art washed up in one of the geographical cradles of the Renaissance. Nor is this the only masterpiece of Baroque sculpture \u2018outside of Rome\u2019 that has escaped the attention of art historians until quite recently, maybe because such works have been considered as a consequence of allogenic stylistic impositions and have not received the attention of scholars much more focused on the study of \u2018regional schools\u2019, valuing evidence of a homogeneous style associated with a particular geographical region above all else.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Simonato__Cardinal_Gianfrancesco_Albani_and_the_arts_between_Rome_and_Urbino/Simonato__Cardinal_Gianfrancesco_Albani_and_the_arts_between_Rome_and_Urbino.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Simonato__Cardinal_Gianfrancesco_Albani_and_the_arts_between_Rome_and_Urbino/Simonato__Cardinal_Gianfrancesco_Albani_and_the_arts_between_Rome_and_Urbino.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Simonato__Cardinal_Gianfrancesco_Albani_and_the_arts_between_Rome_and_Urbino/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Simonato__Cardinal_Gianfrancesco_Albani_and_the_arts_between_Rome_and_Urbino/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Simonato__Cardinal_Gianfrancesco_Albani_and_the_arts_between_Rome_and_Urbino/Simonato CGAatabRaU.zip"]},

Whereas Ackerman\u2019s earlier work assumed a development of the arts as they responded to social, economic, political, and cultural change, his recent work reflects the poststructural critique of the presumption of progress that characterized Renaissance and modernist history and criticism. In this book he explores the tension between the authority of the past\u2013which may act not only as a restraint but as a challenge and stimulus\u2013and the potentially liberating gift of invention.He examines the ways in which artists and writers on art have related to ancestors and to established modes of representation, as well as to contemporary experiences. The \u201corigins\u201d studied here include the earliest art history and criticism; the beginnings of architectural drawing in the Middle Ages and Renaissance; Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s sketches for churches, the first in the Renaissance to propose supporting domes on sculpted walls and piers; and the first architectural photographs. \u201cImitation\u201d refers to artistic achievements that in part depended on the imitation of forms established in practices outside the fine arts, such as ancient Roman rhetoric and print media. \u201cConventions,\u201d like language, facilitate communication between the artist and viewer, but are both more universal (understood across cultures) and more fixed (resisting variation that might diminish their clarity).

Can literature, in fact, be political at all? These are the questions Roland Barthes addresses in Writing Degree Zero, his first published book and a landmark in his oeuvre. The debate had engaged the European literary community since the 1930s; with this fierce manifesto, Barthes challenged the notion of literature\u2019s obligation to be socially committed.

What was it about architecture that enabled it to fulfill such diverse functions over such a long time-span?Castles of the Mind identifies and traces two primary traditions of symbolic textual architecture \u2013 Christian and classicizing \u2013 from antiquity until the end of the Middle Ages. It charts the evolution of the architectural metaphor over time, in relation to social, political and religious contexts, and offers a wealth of information on secular and devotional allegory.Christiania Whitehead suggests new ways of reading and evaluating major medieval texts, such as Chaucer\u2019s House of Fame and Gavin Douglas\u2019s Palis of Honoure, as well as reassessing the importance of many less well-known works.

The urgency of the 1990s pro-practice movement, with its mandate to focus on the realities of building, has shifted architectural theory away from utopian ideals and heavy-handed cultural critiques toward the realities of architecture and building. This transition renders theory\u2019s immediate history particularly relevant to contemporary thought and practice.\nConstructing a New Agenda offers an overview of the myriad approaches and attitudes adopted by architects and architectural theorists during this era. In this long-awaited follow-up to our critically acclaimed and best-selling anthology Theorizing a New Agenda, editor A. Krista Sykes collects twenty-eight essays that address architectural theory from the mid-1990s, where the first volume left off, through the present.Multiple themes\u2014including the impact of digital technologies on processes of architectural design, production, materiality, and representation; the implications of globalization and networks of information; the growing emphasis on sustainable and green architecture; and the phenomenon of the \u201cstarchitect\u201d and iconic architecture\u2014overlap to address the contemporary situation as a whole. By providing, in one place, the keytheoretical texts of the past fifteen years, Constructing a New Agenda becomes a foundation for ongoing discussions surrounding contemporary architectural thought and practice. Contributions by distinguished thinkers and makers such as Stan Allen, Deborah Berke, Michael Braungart, Rem Koolhaas, Sanford Kwinter, Greg Lynn, Reinhold Martin, William McDonough, William Mitchell, Samuel Mockbee, Glenn Murcutt, Jesse Reiser and Nanako Umemoto, Michael Speaks and Anthony Vidler are preceded by brief introductions that establish each essay\u2019s particular historical context and significance.

Based on archival research of probate inventories, it turns out that many artists and artisans had rich collections containing diverse objects (of art, artifice, naturalia, exotica, scientific instruments) and, as such, belonged to a community of knowledgeable liefhebbers (or, at the very least, aspired to be part of this community). The methodological innovation of close reading and analyzing probate inventories of otherwise unknown people, demonstrates that the critical mass of knowledgeable burgers in an early modern city such as Antwerp was much larger than was hitherto known.

This is yet another argument in favor of the thesis of cities as \u2018hubs of knowledge\u2019 in early modern knowledge societies, but it also uncovers new specificities about how the material world was understood in Antwerp\u2019s collectors\u2019 rooms.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rijks__Catalysts_of_Knowledge/Rijks__Catalysts_of_Knowledge.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rijks__Catalysts_of_Knowledge/Rijks__Catalysts_of_Knowledge.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rijks__Catalysts_of_Knowledge/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rijks__Catalysts_of_Knowledge/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rijks__Catalysts_of_Knowledge/Rijks CoK.zip"]},

Whoever then proceeds so far as to walk through the ring of ambits and enter into the courtyard of the church cannot but be gripped with a sensation of the unearthly, the impression of a kind of mysterious space somewhere between earth and heaven. It was precisely in reference to this work by the architect Jan Blazej Santini-Aichel (1677-1723) that the German scholar Erich Bachmann wrote, half a century ago, that \u201cin its artistic consistence, formal symbolism and polyphonic richness, it exceeded anything that up to that point had been created in works of its type in Bohemia and Central Europe as a whole\u201d. Three decades later, the Czech art historian Mojmir Horyna, author of the hitherto unsurpassed monograph about the artist, stated that\u201dthe pilgrimage church forms the apogee of his [Santini\u2019s] creative trajectory and the culmination of the movement of his invention towards an individual and yet timeless conception of architecture\u201d. Horyna himself later compiled the nomination proposal for registration of this landmark in the UNESCO Register of World Heritage, eventually granted in 1994. At the same time, this highest of international heritage statuses had also been awarded, if indirectly, to other buildings by Santini: his works in the historic centers of Prague and Kutna Hora, with the second case extended to include his adaptation of the former Cistercian monastery in the outlying suburb of Sedlec.

Then he proceeded to his larger theme, a cosmic interpretation of in terms of the struggle between good and evil the City of God in conflict with the Earthly City or the City of the Devil.

All the buildings studied in the chapters of this section were designed by architects who were born at the end of the nineteenth century and practiced at the beginning of the twentieth century. They were part of a generation that witnessed unparalleled modernization first hand, an experience that deeply influenced the way they thought architecture had to engage the world. While the concept of the \u201cmodern\u201d had been long in the making \u2013 from the seventeenth century quarrel against the supremacy of the ancients to the Enlightenment ideas of critical reason \u2013 industrialization brought about an unprecedented world, so radically transformed that its inhabitants struggled to recognize it. Modem life was catapulted into existence through urban developments that took place at a record pace, changing the world more rapidly and dramatically than ever before.The industrial city witnessed an extreme urbanization, no longer composed of familiar expressions of communal intimacy, tom by political turmoil, and increasingly questioning established traditions and patterns of behavior. Modernization was intimately linked to the modem city, where the industrial environment with its factories, credit networks, new institutional systems, and communication and information technologies drew an unmatched number of workers to urban areas. The flow of migration into cities between 1800 and 1900 was dramatic and drastically changed urban-rural relationships. In Europe, London\u2019s population increased from 1.2 to 4.5 million, and Berlin\u2019s from 172,000 to 1.9 million. Cities in the United States surpassed these statistics, with New York growing from 60,000 to 3.5 million and Chicago developing from a settler\u2019s village around 1800 to a metropolis with 1.7 million inhabitants. This rapid growth in population did not match the construction efforts, resulting in densities that in many cities reached its all-time high by the end of the nineteenth century. Observing an environment that sharply contrasted with the previously known world, Friedrich Engels wrote: \u201c[the modem city is an] urban mess \u2026 and the result of a gigantic accident.\u201d The poor working, living, and urban conditions of cities, were for Engels conditioned by modern industrial capitalism, giving The Companions to the History of Architecture, Volume IV, Twentieth-Century Architecture.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Leatherbarrow_Eisenschmidt__Twentieth_Century_Architecture/Leatherbarrow_Eisenschmidt__Twentieth_Century_Architecture.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Leatherbarrow_Eisenschmidt__Twentieth_Century_Architecture/Leatherbarrow_Eisenschmidt__Twentieth_Century_Architecture.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Leatherbarrow_Eisenschmidt__Twentieth_Century_Architecture/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Leatherbarrow_Eisenschmidt__Twentieth_Century_Architecture/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Leatherbarrow_Eisenschmidt__Twentieth_Century_Architecture/Leatherbarrow Eisenschmidt TCA.zip"]},

In this three-part polemical masterpiece, the famed engraver and designer not only praises the structural audacity of Etruscan architecture and contends that the Etruscans\u2014not the Greeks\u2014were the artistic mentors of the Romans but also argues for a Roman-inspired exuberance in design that draws freely on all forms and traditions of ancient art.Although Piranesi\u2019s essentially Baroque vision set him at odds with the austere aesthetics of Neoclassicism, his ideas were inspirational to such gifted eighteenth-century architects as Robert Adam, John Soane, Claude-Nicolas Ledoux, and \u00c9tienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e. Today, Piranesi\u2019s lively plea for imaginative eclecticism remains topical, as practitioners and theorists continue to debate the relative merits of a rational and minimal architecture versus an architecture rich in ornament and historical references.John Wilton-Ely is professor emeritus in the history of art at the University of Hull, England, and the author of the definitive works on Piranesi including Piranesi as Architect and Designer and Giovanni Battista Piranesi: The Complete Etchings.

In Architectural Diplomacy, Gil Smith observes that at a time when building activity in Rome was greatly diminished, the Accademia became a successful laboratory of ideas where design methods, such as the productive fusing of French and Italian Baroque traditions, were tested for perhaps the first time before becoming common coin in eighteenth-century architecture. Smith uses these public competitions, held for the 25 years after the Accademia\u2019s union with the French academies, as evidence that the Accademia was of central importance to the architectural history of the Baroque. It was also a place where new typologies and design methods arising from exchanges between French and Roman architectural traditions could flourish, and an important source of inspiration for such prominent architects of the next century as J. B. Fischer von Erlach, Filippo Juvarra, and others who searched for a progressive, synthetic Baroque language.The drawings also provide a means of studying the influence of such teachers and architect-academicians as Mattia de Rossi and Carlo Fontana (two heirs of Bernini) on a generation of young architects.

Wooden sculptures of the saints, the Immaculate Conception, or the Passion of Christ were painstakingly carved, gessoed, and intricately painted, even embellished with glass eyes and tears and ivory teeth. Some were shockingly graphic in their depiction of Christ\u2019s sufferings; others, beautifully clothed, appeared to bring saints to glorious life. These were objects of divine inspiration to the faithful, whether displayed on altars or processed through the streets on holy days.Featuring new photography, this book reappraises the unique form of Spanish painted wooden sculpture. In addition to examining the sculpture\u2019s religious roles, it also explores the unique creative relationship of sculptor and painter: Velazquez\u2019s teacher and father-in-law Francisco Pacheco, for example, often painted the flesh and drapery of wood carvings by the celebrated sculptor Juan Martinez Monta\u00f1\u00e8s, and taught a generation of students.

In this major reinterpretation of epic poetry beginning with Virgil, David Quint explores the political context and meanings of key works in Western literature. He divides the history of the genre into two political traditions: the Virgilian epics of conquest and empire that take the victors\u2019 side (the Aeneid itself, Camoes\u2019s Lus\u00edadas, Tasso\u2019s Gerusalemme liberata) and the countervailing epic of the defeated and of republican liberty (Lucan\u2019s Pharsalia, Ercilla\u2019s Araucana, and d\u2019Aubign\u00e9\u2019s Les tragiques). These traditions produce opposing ideas of historical narrative: a linear, teleological narrative that belongs to the imperial conquerors, and an episodic and open-ended narrative identified with \u201cromance,\u201d the story told of and by the defeated.Quint situates Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained within these rival traditions. He extends his political analysis to the scholarly revival of medieval epic in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and to Sergei Eisenstein\u2019s epic film, Alexander Nevsky. Attending both to the topical contexts of individual poems and to the larger historical development of the epic genre, Epic and Empire provides new models for exploring the relationship between ideology and literary form.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Quint__Epic_and_Empire/Quint__Epic_and_Empire.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Quint__Epic_and_Empire/Quint__Epic_and_Empire.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Quint__Epic_and_Empire/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Quint__Epic_and_Empire/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Quint__Epic_and_Empire/Quint EaE.zip"]},

But perhaps a greater achievement was his translation of The Ten Books of Architecture by the classical Roman theorist Vitruvius, published in 1673. The Latin author was not only made to \u201cspeak French\u201d in a most eloquent fashion, but he was also interpreted. Perrault\u2019s scrupulous annotation, which nearly envelops the lone surviving architectural treatise from antiquity, has never been excelled in its scholarship and intellectual stamina. On the basis of this learned second discourse, Claude Perrault began to compose the first post-Renaissance treatise on architecture, one in which the rules of architectural design were now to be determined not by apodictic ancient precedents but by reason and\u2014above all\u2014by a variable national taste. The Ordonnance for the Five Kinds of Columns after the Method of the Ancients, 1683, was the culmination of Perrault\u2019s efforts.

The book marks the shift from the urban doctrines of modernism to a rediscovery of the traditional European city. In this book, Rossi criticizes the lack of understanding of the city in current architectural practice. He argues that a city must be studied and valued as something constructed over time; of particular interest are urban artifacts that withstand the passage of time. Rossi held that the city remembers its past (our \u201ccollective memory\u201d), and that we use that memory through monuments; that is, monuments give structure to the city. His book has been a major reference for the reconstruction of the city of Berlin after the German reunification in 1990.Aldo Rossi, a practicing architect and leader of the Italian architectural movement La Tendenza, is also one of the most influential theorists today. The Architecture of the City is his major work of architectural and urban theory. In part a protest against functionalism and the Modern Movement, in part an attempt to restore the craft of architecture to its position as the only valid object of architectural study, and in part an analysis of the rules and forms of the city\u2019s construction, the book has become immensely popular among architects and design students.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rossi__The_Architecture_of_the_City/Rossi__The_Architecture_of_the_City.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rossi__The_Architecture_of_the_City/Rossi__The_Architecture_of_the_City.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rossi__The_Architecture_of_the_City/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rossi__The_Architecture_of_the_City/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rossi__The_Architecture_of_the_City/Rossi TAotC.zip"]},

Yet we live in an age which, following the postmodernist dictum that any sign can only refer to other signs, has declared all language liable to the \u2018allegorical condition\u2019.This paradox has led the author to question the epistemological assumptions underlying allegories composed in an era which, conversely, favoured the oblique form of expression while professing its belief in the divine Logos as the ultimate ground of all meaning. If art and doctrine appear so divided on the subject of allegory in our own day, then might not the relationship between allegorical writing and interpretation in the Middle Ages have been more complex than is often assumed? How solid are the grounds on which Michel Foucault has based his distinction between early modernity and its past \u2013 a time when, he claims, the languages of the world were still perceived to make up \u201cthe image of the truth\u201d?The present study addresses these and related questions through a heuristic comparison between historically and culturally different approaches to narrative allegory. In her analysis of the late-fourteenth century dream poem Piers Plowman by William Langland, Kasten sets up a critical dialogue between this extraordinary work and Walter Benjamin\u2019s study of German baroque allegory, The Origin of German Tragic Drama. Far from serving the narrow purposes of didacticism, she contends, Piers Plowman invites a reconsideration of the very grounds on which (post-) modernity has tried to distance itself from its cultural past.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Kasten__In_Search_of_Kynde_Knowynge/Kasten__In_Search_of_Kynde_Knowynge.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Kasten__In_Search_of_Kynde_Knowynge/Kasten__In_Search_of_Kynde_Knowynge.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Kasten__In_Search_of_Kynde_Knowynge/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Kasten__In_Search_of_Kynde_Knowynge/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Kasten__In_Search_of_Kynde_Knowynge/Kasten ISoKK.zip"]},

It seemed to the author that the painting and sculpture of the Church would gain additional interest if they were displayed in relation to the Church s poetry. In the case of highly developed art, such a literary interpretation is doubtless superfluous. The work of the Renaissance, and especially of the High Renaissance, certainly does not require any textual commentary in order to be immediately appreciated. In Medieval art, however, there are many features which seem strange to any one who has not been initiated into the medieval conception of life; and if here, too, the purely artistic element can be understood and explained only with the help of a criticism which, in the fir st place, pays attention to the technical qualities, yet that element is often hidden from the superficial view. Therefore the study of the literary motive, which in modern art is rightly considered to be of secondary importance, may, in the case of the older painting, serve as a help to the attention and an aid to the memory. For the present writer, at any rate, the old pictures gained an additional attraction after he had learned to recognize all the ideas to which they gave expression; and it seemed as if even the religious sculptures and pictures would have more to tell, from a purely artistic point of view, if one tried to look at them as they were looked at by the faithful.

By shifting attention from artistic intentionality to reception, Pamela Jones reintegrates these altarpieces into the urban fabric of early modern Rome, allowing us to see the five paintings anew through the eyes of their original audiences, both women and men, rich and poor, pious and impious. Because Italian churchmen relied, after the Council of Trent, on public altarpieces more than any other type of contemporary painting in their attempts to reform and inspire Catholic society, it is on altarpieces that Pamela Jones centers her inquiry. Through detailed study of evidence in many genres \u2013 including not only painting, prints, and art criticism, but also cheap pamphlets, drama, sermons, devotional tracts, rules of religious orders, pilgrimages, rituals, diaries, and letters \u2013 Jones shows how various beholders made meaning of the altarpieces in their aesthetic, devotional, social, and charitable dimensions. This study presents early modern Catholicism and its art in an entirely new light by addressing the responses of members of all social classes \u2013 not just elites \u2013 to art created for the public. It also provides a more accurate view of the range of religious ideas that circulated in early modern Rome by bringing to bear both officially sanctioned religious art and literature and unauthorized but widely disseminated cheap pamphlets and prints that were published without the mandatory religious permission. On this basis, Jones helps to illuminate further the insurmountable problems churchmen faced when attempting to channel the power of sacred art to elicit orthodox responses.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Jones__Altarpieces_and_Their_Viewers_in_the_Churches_of_Rome_from_Caravaggio_to_Guido_Reni/Jones__Altarpieces_and_Their_Viewers_in_the_Churches_of_Rome_from_Caravaggio_to_Guido_Reni.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Jones__Altarpieces_and_Their_Viewers_in_the_Churches_of_Rome_from_Caravaggio_to_Guido_Reni/Jones__Altarpieces_and_Their_Viewers_in_the_Churches_of_Rome_from_Caravaggio_to_Guido_Reni.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Jones__Altarpieces_and_Their_Viewers_in_the_Churches_of_Rome_from_Caravaggio_to_Guido_Reni/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Jones__Altarpieces_and_Their_Viewers_in_the_Churches_of_Rome_from_Caravaggio_to_Guido_Reni/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Jones__Altarpieces_and_Their_Viewers_in_the_Churches_of_Rome_from_Caravaggio_to_Guido_Reni/Jones AaTVitCoRfCtGR.zip"]},

Recent historical studies, however, have emphasized the intense fear of God that held Early Modern society in its grip, leading to a revision of the traditional view of the Counter Reformation as a top-down process. This revision has important implications for the history of art, as it challenges us to reconsider the notion of religious art and architecture during the Counter Reformation as rhetorical \u201cpropaganda\u201d. In the present dissertation I approach the religious art patronage in the Catholic South from a perspective informed by recent developments in ethnography and anthropology. I propose to redefine the \u201cbaroque piety\u201d of religious patronage that generated works of art and architecture not as a strategy to persuade (in a rhetorical way), but to negotiate with the divine in a continuous process of reconciliation, aiming to regain divine grace. Put in anthropological terms, works of art served as ritual interfaces to enter into negotiation with the divine. This negotiation with God took place within networks of social relations (nexuses) in which art and architecture functioned as agents of change.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Nagelsmit__Venite_and_Videte/Nagelsmit__Venite_and_Videte.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Nagelsmit__Venite_and_Videte/Nagelsmit__Venite_and_Videte.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Nagelsmit__Venite_and_Videte/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Nagelsmit__Venite_and_Videte/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Nagelsmit__Venite_and_Videte/Nagelsmit VaV.zip"]},

This statement, formulated in appropriately visual terms, characterizes painting as a way of looking and seeing, a mode of vision. In making such a claim, the artist steps aside from the familiar debate about whether painting was a manual or an intellectual discipline, and moves beyond any idea of it as simply a means of representing the external world: the painter\u2019s definitive faculty of vision can reach further than those realities which present themselves to the eye. John Peacock analyses the motif of looking \u2013 the ways in which figures regard or disregard each other \u2013 throughout Van Dyck\u2019s work, and the images of the sunflower and the gold chain in this particular portrait, to reveal what is essentially an idealist conception of pictorial art.

Classical buildings as widely spaced in time as a Roman temple, an Italian Renaissance palace and a Regency house all show an awareness of these rules even if they vary them, break them or poetically contradict them. Sir Christopher Wren described them as the \u201cLatin\u201d of architecture and the analogy is almost exact. There is the difference, however, that whereas the learning of Latin is a slow and difficult business, the language of classical architecture is relatively simple. It is still, to a great extent, the mode of expression of our urban surroundings, since classical architecture was the common language of the western world till comparatively recent times. Anybody to whom architecture makes a strong appeal has probably already discovered something of its grammar for himself.In this book, the author\u2019s purpose is to set out as simply and vividly as possible the exact grammatical workings of this architectural language. He is less concerned with its development in Greece and Rome than with its expansion and use in the centuries since the Renaissance.

Presenting research by an international community of scholars, this book explores through a series of cross sections the traffic of ideas between practice and history that has shaped modern architecture and the academic discipline of architectural history across the long twentieth century.

It is thought-provoking and will stimulate debate amongst a specialist audience and capture the imagination of a non-specialist audience, providing them with new insight into Palladian design principle across time and place.The catalogue includes the following essays:-Palladio, Palladianism, Palladians by Guido Beltramini\n-Palladianism: A Project of Radical Discontinuity by Pier Vittorio Aureli\n-Cyma Recta: Palladianism and the Everyday by Daniel MaudlinThe catalogue accompanies the exhibition on Palladian Design that was on display in the Architecture Gallery at RIBA (from 9 September 2015 to 9 January 2016).", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Riba_Publishing__Palladian_Design_The_Good_the_Bad_and_the_Unexpected/Riba_Publishing__Palladian_Design_The_Good_the_Bad_and_the_Unexpected.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Riba_Publishing__Palladian_Design_The_Good_the_Bad_and_the_Unexpected/Riba_Publishing__Palladian_Design_The_Good_the_Bad_and_the_Unexpected.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Riba_Publishing__Palladian_Design_The_Good_the_Bad_and_the_Unexpected/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Riba_Publishing__Palladian_Design_The_Good_the_Bad_and_the_Unexpected/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Riba_Publishing__Palladian_Design_The_Good_the_Bad_and_the_Unexpected/RibaPublishing PDTGtBatU.zip"]},

Tabulae Anatomicae a Celeberrimo Pictore Petro Berrettino Cortonesi. Text by Cajetano Petrioli. [4], 84 pp. Illustrated with an engraved plate on title and 27 full-page engraved anatomical plates after Pietro da Cortona. Folio, 405 x 285 mm, bound in contemporary Italian calf. Rome: Antonii de Rubeis, 1741.First Edition. One of the most artistic anatomical atlases ever published. The images were designed by the great Italian painter of the High Baroque period, Pietro da Cortona. \u201cThere is no doubt that among Italian painters, he [Pietro da Cortona] must be considered the most influential personality of his generation, and this pre-eminence was recognized by his own contemporaries\u201d (Encyclopedia of World Art XI, 355-56).Cortona\u2019s elegant figures echo the style of other Renaissance Baroque artists, however, these studies for the Tabulae Anatomicae stand apart from those of his contemporaries. Cortona prepared the original drawings around the year 1618 when he was barely twenty years old. The original drawings, executed on grey paper in brown ink, were perhaps done as a commission for a work that remained unpublished. They were acquired in the eighteenth-century by the fervent collector Sir William Hamilton, then English Ambassador to the King of Naples, and are preserved today in the medical collection at the University of Glasgow Library.The drawings were not engraved nor published until a hundred years after the artist\u2019s death, for the first time in this Roman edition. Cortona placed his classical anatomical figures within and around Renaissance columns, plinths and arches with architectural vignettes in the backgrounds. Additionally, \u201cmany of the dissected men hold oval or rectangular medallions- they look like framed mirrors- within which are drawn figures detailing the anatomy of various regions\u201d (Roberts & Tomlinson p. 273). Plates 1 & 4 are signed: \u201cL.C.,\u201d who is probably the Urbino painter and copper-engraver Luca Ciamberlano.Pietro da Cortona, born Pietro Berrettini da Cortona, (1596-1669), was particularily celebrated for his frescos and ceilings in the Palazzos Barberini, Pitti and Pamphili. \u201cCortona\u2019s works are the most spectacular achievements of mid-seventeenth-century Italian painting\u2026. This [the Gran Salone of the Palazzo Barberini] was the most important commission of the 1630s, and Cortona produced a fresco that is for Roman Baroque painting what Michelangelo\u2019s Sistine Ceiling is for Roman High Renaissance painting- the grandest and most complete statement of its aesthetic ideals\u201d (Held & Posner, 17th and 18th Century Art, pp. 107-109).An interesting side note is to be found in the vignette by Pietroli at the lower left of the title-page engraving; it depicts a transfusion from the carotid artery of a lamb into a vein in the left forearm of the recipient man holding the lamb with his right arm. Transfusions from animals to humans began in 1667, but the first transfusions from human to human did not take place until the nineteenth century.

Inheriting his basic ideas and conceptions of art and beauty from the classical world, Aquinas transformed or modified these ideas in the light of Christian theology and of developments in metaphysics and optics during the thirteenth century.Setting the stage with an account of the vivid aesthetic and artistic sensibility that flourished in medieval times, Eco examines Aquinas\u2019s conception of transcendental beauty, his theory of aesthetic perception or visio, and his account of the three conditions of beauty\u2014integrity, proportion, and clarity\u2014that, centuries later, emerged again in the writings of the young James Joyce. He examines the concrete application of these theories in Aquinas\u2019s reflections on God, mankind, music, poetry, and scripture. He discusses Aquinas\u2019s views on art and compares his poetics with Dante\u2019s. In a final chapter added to the second Italian edition, Eco examines how Aquinas\u2019s aesthetics came to be absorbed and superseded in late medieval times and draws instructive parallels between Thomistic methodology and contemporary structuralism. As the only book-length treatment of Aquinas\u2019s aesthetics available in English, this volume should interest philosophers, medievalists, historians, critics, and anyone involved in poetics, aesthetics, or the history of ideas.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Eco__The_Aesthetics_of_Thomas_Aquinas/Eco__The_Aesthetics_of_Thomas_Aquinas.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Eco__The_Aesthetics_of_Thomas_Aquinas/Eco__The_Aesthetics_of_Thomas_Aquinas.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Eco__The_Aesthetics_of_Thomas_Aquinas/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Eco__The_Aesthetics_of_Thomas_Aquinas/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Eco__The_Aesthetics_of_Thomas_Aquinas/Eco TAoTA.zip"]},

In his own day, he was most celebrated for his Vedute, 137 etchings of ancient and modern Rome; so renowned were these startling and dramatic chiaroscuro images, imbued with Piranesi\u2019s romantic feeling for archaeological ruins, that they formed the mental picture of Rome for generations after. Indeed, Piranesi could be said to have shaped a whole strain of contemporary architecture, as well as the wider visualization of antiquity itself. In our time, he has had a direct influence on writers such as Borges and Kafka and on filmmakers such as Terry Gilliam and Peter Greenaway.

Sculpture was at the center of theoretical debates concerning the relative merits of the different arts, the differences between ancient and modern art, and the relationship between art and nature. Rome was a major center for these theoretical debates, as well as a locus for patronage and collecting. Sculptors from all over Europe came to Rome to study the remains of the antique past and to practice their art. Critical Perspectives on Roman Baroque Sculpture stakes out a new frontier of research on seventeenth-century sculpture in Rome\u2013a frontier that looks well beyond attributional and technical questions, instead focusing on questions of historical context and criticism including the interaction of sculptural theory and practice; the creative roles of sculptors and their patrons; the relationship of sculpture to its antique models and to contemporary painting; and problems of contextual meaning and reception.Aside from the editors, the contributors are Michael Cole, Julia K.

The porous limestone temples with rough, heavy columns were entirely unlike the classical architecture travelers to the site were familiar with. Paestum, exceptional in the completeness of its ruins, came to fascinate architects, artists, writers, and tourists alike, who documented the site in drawings and texts. In Rediscovering Architecture, Sigrid de Jong analyzes extensive original source material, including letters, diaries, drawings, paintings, engravings, and published texts, which are attractively reproduced here. The book offers new insights on the explorations of the site, the diverse reactions to it, and their dramatic and enduring effect on architectural thought, as they influenced intellectual debates in England, France, and Italy during the long 18th century. This unique study of the experience of architecture reconstructs Paestum\u2019s key role in the discourse on classical architecture and its historiography, primitivism, the sublime and the picturesque, and the growing importance of science and history in architectural thought.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_De_Jong__Rediscovering_Architecture/De_Jong__Rediscovering_Architecture.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_De_Jong__Rediscovering_Architecture/De_Jong__Rediscovering_Architecture.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_De_Jong__Rediscovering_Architecture/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_De_Jong__Rediscovering_Architecture/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_De_Jong__Rediscovering_Architecture/DeJong RA.zip"]},

By means of rituals of foundation, dedication and consecration, buildings and objects are charged with meaning.

As such, the study of these rituals deepens our understanding of society at large.

Sacred places are places apart.It is this specificity in the context of the Christian religions of the West that the contributors to Loci Sacri wishes to unveil by bringing together specialists from various disciplines, countries, and Christian denominations.

Less known is the fact that the institution\u2019s art museum was the culmination of many decades of reflection on the aesthetic qualities and religious roles of art. Borromeo recorded his reflections in two treatises.De pictura sacra (Sacred Painting, 1624) laid out the rules that artists should follow when creating religious art. Borromeo touched on dozens of iconographical issues and in so doing drew on his deep knowledge not only of church fathers, councils, and scripture but also of classical art and literature. In Mus\u00e6um (1625) Borromeo showed a less doctrinaire and more personal side by walking the reader through the Ambrosiana and commenting on specific works in his collection. He offered some of the earliest and most important critiques to survive on works by artists such as Leonardo, Titian, and Jan Brueghel the Elder.This volume offers, for the first time, translations of the treatises directly into English as well as freshly edited Latin texts, an introduction, extensive notes, and an appendix on the Academy of Design that was established in conjunction with the museum.

In this engrossing book, an internationally respected historian gives an account of contemporary representations of Louis XIV and shows how the making of the royal image illuminates the relationship between art and power. Images of Louis XIV included hundreds of oil paintings and engravings, three-hundred-odd medals struck to commemorate the major events of the reign, sculptures, and bronzes, as well as plays, ballets (in which the king himself sometimes appeared on stage), operas, odes, sermons, official newspapers and histories, fireworks, fountains, and tapestries. Drawing on an analysis of these representations as well as on surviving documentary sources, Peter Burke shows the conscious attempt to \u201cinvent\u201d the image of the king and reveals how the supervision of the royal image was entrusted to a commitee, the so-called small academy. This book is not only a fascinating chronological study of the mechanics of the image-making of a king over the course of a seventy-year reign but is also an investigation into the genre of cultural construction. Burke discusses the element of propaganda implicit in image-making, the manipulation of seventeenth-century media of communication (oral, visual, and textual) and their codes (literary and artistic), and the intended audience and its response. He concludes by comparing and contrasting Louis\u2019s public image with that of other rulers ranging from Augustus to contemporary American presidents.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Burke__The_Fabrication_of_Louis_XIV/Burke__The_Fabrication_of_Louis_XIV.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Burke__The_Fabrication_of_Louis_XIV/Burke__The_Fabrication_of_Louis_XIV.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Burke__The_Fabrication_of_Louis_XIV/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Burke__The_Fabrication_of_Louis_XIV/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Burke__The_Fabrication_of_Louis_XIV/Burke TFoLX.zip"]},

For the Adam brothers, Robert and James, Italy offered a world of intense intellectual, professional and social development. The limited attainments of their Scottish education had equipped all three brothers to practice architecture in Scotland, but little else. To attain greater things, they needed the space to branch out and break with tradition. This meant travel abroad. For anyone interested in extending or developing their understanding of the visual arts in the eighteenth century, this certainly meant Italy, regarded as the cradle of antiquity and centre of the classical world. For the Adam brothers, the purpose of their tours was to provide them with a clear understanding of classical architecture and enable them to effectively express that understanding pictorially. Such was the bedrock of the Adam style and the basis of their later triumph in London. Accompanied by a fascinating text by world renowned art historian Professor A A Tait, the drawings reproduced in this beautifully produced book are all taken from the collection of 57 volumes of Adam drawings purchased by Sir John Soane and held in the Sir John Soane Museum, London, many of which have never been published before.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Tait__The_Adam_Brothers_in_Rome/Tait__The_Adam_Brothers_in_Rome.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Tait__The_Adam_Brothers_in_Rome/Tait__The_Adam_Brothers_in_Rome.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Tait__The_Adam_Brothers_in_Rome/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Tait__The_Adam_Brothers_in_Rome/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Tait__The_Adam_Brothers_in_Rome/Tait tABiR.zip"]},

By analysing the elements of fantasy in Lauro and Kircher\u2019s archaeological visions, new levels of meaning appear. Instead of being testimonies of failed archaeology, they emerge as complex architectural messages responding to moral, political, and religious issues of the day.

The thesis has the form of a narrated dialogue between these two writers and the narrator, and it is situated at Hagley Park, Worchestershire, England. The work does not have a strictly art-historical aim, but wishes to provide new insights in the field of archi\u00adtectural research on both a methodological and an historical level. While the dialogical mode of writing is explored as an hermeneutical research method for the field of architec\u00adtural history and theory, the text in itself discloses a world of reflec\u00adtions and ideas that surrounded the English landscape garden in the 1770\u2019s, and engages, from our present-day po\u00adsi\u00adtion, in a dialogue with that world.The beginnings of diverse and opposing phenomena of our time can be traced to the culture of the 18th century. As con\u00adstructions of the 18th century, Hagley Park, as well as Whately and Heely\u2019s texts, lead us closer to the horizons of the indi\u00adviduals and the society that produced it. But the landscape gar\u00adden and the texts, as they stand to\u00adday, are also sites for alter\u00adnative epistemological models. Through its fictional character, the landscape garden provides a possibility to move within interpretative layers and spiraling horizons.

The grand stairway that he built at the Tuileries Palace was demolished in 1664, as was his Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-L\u00e9ger in 1668, to make way for classical structures. In 1683, he was denounced by F. Blondel of the Royal Academy for his villainous Gothic ornaments\u201d and his \u201cpetty manner\u201d. Nonetheless, his two major theoretical works on construction and design continued to be important textbooks, and were regularly republished and read.His reputation rose again in the 18th century, through the writings of Dezallier d\u2019Argenville, who wrote in 1787 that he had \u201cabandoned the Gothic covering in order to redress French architecture in the style Ancient Greece.\u201d D\u2019Argenville wrote the first biography and catalog of works. Though few of his building survived to be studied carefully, later important academic works on de l\u2019Orme were written in the 19th and 20th centuries by art historians including H. Clouzot and Anthony Blunt.One of De l\u2019Orme\u2019s primary accomplishments was to change the way architects trained and studied. He insisted that architects needed formal education in classical architecture, as well as in geometry and astronomy and the sciences, but also needed practical experience in construction. He himself was an accomplished scholar of ancient Greek and Roman architecture, as well as a humanist scholar. He argued that architects needed to be able to design and manage every aspect of the building, from the volumes to the lambris to adding up the cost, making detailed three-dimensional drawings of vaults, judging if wood was dry enough, and knowing to stop digging the foundation when the first sand was encountered. He had scorn for those architects who could design a facade but had no knowledge actual construction. His opponents scorned him for his background as the son of a masonry contractor. He was referred to by Bernard Palissy as \u201cThe god of the stone masons\u201d, which deeply offended him.His other major accomplishment was to resist the tendency to simply copy Italian architectural styles; he traveled and studied in Italy, and borrowed much, but he always added a distinctly French look to each of his projects.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Blunt__Philibert_de_lOrme/Blunt__Philibert_de_lOrme.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Blunt__Philibert_de_lOrme/Blunt__Philibert_de_lOrme.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Blunt__Philibert_de_lOrme/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Blunt__Philibert_de_lOrme/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Blunt__Philibert_de_lOrme/Blunt PO.zip"]},

In the decades after the Second World War, when architectural historians began to assess the legacy of the avant-gardes in order to construct a coherent narrative of modernism\u2019s development, they were inevitably influenced by contemporary concerns. In Histories of the Immediate Present, Anthony Vidler examines the work of four historians of architectural modernism and the ways in which their histories were constructed as more or less overt programs for the theory and practice of design in a contemporary context. Vidler looks at the historical approaches of Emil Kaufmann, Colin Rowe, Reyner Banham, and Manfredo Tafuri, and the specific versions of modernism advanced by their historical narratives. Vidler shows that the modernism conceived by Kaufmann was, like the late Enlightenment projects he revered, one of pure, geometrical forms and elemental composition; that of Rowe saw mannerist ambiguity and complexity in contemporary design; Banham\u2019s modernism took its cue from the aspirations of the futurists; and the \u201cRenaissance modernism\u201d of Tafuri found its source in the division between the technical experimentation of Brunelleschi and the cultural nostalgia of Alberti. Vidler\u2019s investigation demonstrates the inevitable collusion between history and design that pervades all modern architectural discourse and has given rise to some of the most interesting architectual experiments of the postwar period.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Vidler__Histories_of_the_Immediate_Present/Vidler__Histories_of_the_Immediate_Present.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Vidler__Histories_of_the_Immediate_Present/Vidler__Histories_of_the_Immediate_Present.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Vidler__Histories_of_the_Immediate_Present/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Vidler__Histories_of_the_Immediate_Present/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Vidler__Histories_of_the_Immediate_Present/Vidler HotIP.zip"]},

But many texts elude such easy classification, such as the prolonged (but hardly studied) discussions on church architecture, which are both in form and content very different from the way that theme was handled in Italian Renaissance treatises. This collection of English writing on architecture from 1540 to 1750 offers a large selection of fragments, some of them never published before. They discuss the nature of architecture, the practicalities of building, the sense of the past, religious architecture and classicism. All fragments are introduced and annotated to facilitate use both by architectural historians and in the class-room. Authors include well-known writers such as Inigo Jones, Roger Pratt, John Evelyn, or Sir John Vanbrugh, but also some writers who are not usually associated with architectural theory, such as John Donne or Walter Montague, who nonetheless have a lot to tell us about the ways architecture was perceived.

Where the skilled artisan had worked under the sign of light-fingered Mercury, the ambitious artist identified himself with the mysterious and brooding Saturn. Alienation, in effect, was a rung by which artists sought to climb the social ladder.As to the reputed madness of artists\u2014well, some have been as mad as hatters, some as tough-minded as the shrewdest businessmen, and many others wildly and willfully eccentric but hardly crazy. What is certain is that no book presents such a splendid compendium of information about artists\u2019 lives, from the early Renaissance to the beginning of the Romantic era, as Born Under Saturn.

Thinking about material durability, this book suggests, was one of the key ways in which revolutionaries conceptualized duration, and it was crucial to how they imagined the Revolution\u2019s transformative role in history.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Taws__The_Politics_of_the_Provisional/Taws__The_Politics_of_the_Provisional.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Taws__The_Politics_of_the_Provisional/Taws__The_Politics_of_the_Provisional.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Taws__The_Politics_of_the_Provisional/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Taws__The_Politics_of_the_Provisional/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Taws__The_Politics_of_the_Provisional/Taws TPotP.zip"]},

Spuybroek argues that we must \u2018undo\u2019 the twentieth century and learn to understand the aesthetic insights of the nineteenth-century art critic John Ruskin, from which he distils pointers for the contemporary age. Linking philosophy, design, and the digital, with art history, architecture, and craft, Spuybroek explores the romantic notion of \u2018sympathy\u2019, a core concept in Ruskin\u2019s aesthetics, re-evaluating it as the driving force of the twenty-first century aesthetic experience. For Ruskin, beauty always comprises variation, imperfection and fragility, three concepts that wholly disappeared from our mindsets during the twentieth century, but which Spuybroek argues to be central to contemporary aesthetics and design. Revised throughout, and a new foreword by philosopher Brian Massumi, this is a new edition of a seminal work which has drawn praise from fields as diverse as digital architecture and speculative realism, and will continue to be influential as it wrests Ruskin\u2019s ideas out of the Victorian era and reconstructs them for the modern age.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Spuybroek__The_Sympathy_of_Things/Spuybroek__The_Sympathy_of_Things.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Spuybroek__The_Sympathy_of_Things/Spuybroek__The_Sympathy_of_Things.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Spuybroek__The_Sympathy_of_Things/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Spuybroek__The_Sympathy_of_Things/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Spuybroek__The_Sympathy_of_Things/Spuybroek TSoT.zip"]},

Iconoclastic, temperamental, and free from the constraints of society, these towering figures have been treated as fixed icons regardless of historical context or individual situation. In The Absolute Artist, Catherine M. Soussloff challenges this view in an engaging consideration of the social construction of the artist from the fifteenth century to the present.Traditional art history has held that the concept of the artist-genius arose in the Enlightenment. Soussloff disputes this, arguing that earlier writings\u2014artists\u2019 biographies written as long ago as the early fifteenth century-determined and continue to determine our understanding of the myth of the artist. Moving chronologically, Soussloff shifts from fifteenth-century Florence to nineteenth-century Germany, the birthplace of the discipline of art history in its academic form, and considers the cultural historiography of Aby Warburg and Jacob Burckhardt. She discusses intellectual life in early-twentieth-century Vienna, demonstrating the rich cross-fertilization that occurred between art history and psychoanalysis, and scrutinizes the historical situation of Jewish art historians and psychoanalysts in Vienna in the 1930s, considering the impact of exile and an assimilationist ethic on the discourse of art history.Soussloff concludes with a groundbreaking analysis of one of the earliest and most persistent elements of biography, the \u201cartist anecdote,\u201d demonstrating that it is essential in the construction of the figure of the artist. Singular in its breadth and ambition, The Absolute Artist is the first book to analyze the artist\u2019s biography as a rhetorical form and literary genre rather than as an unassailable source of fact and knowledge.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Soussloff__The_Absolute_Artist/Soussloff__The_Absolute_Artist.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Soussloff__The_Absolute_Artist/Soussloff__The_Absolute_Artist.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Soussloff__The_Absolute_Artist/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Soussloff__The_Absolute_Artist/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Soussloff__The_Absolute_Artist/Soussloff TaA.zip"]},

Like many of the artist-theorists of his generation, he desired to image the unimaginable, whether located in the distant past or in the intangible present. To that end, he developed a universal hermeneutics of root lines, colors, and vectors. This scheme still remains fundamental to any understanding of the visionary and geometric strain of Romantic abstraction and of fin-de-si\u00e8cle Symbolism. \u2026 Humbert\u2019s system was also in advance of the general theory of semiotics devised in the mid-nineteenth century by Charles Saunders Peirce. It further adumbrated early twentieth-century emblematic totemism, developed by Emile Durkheim \u2026 [and] anticipated the French Structuralist anthropologist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss\u2019s method of abstracting from individuals. \u2026 Not unlike Coleridge or Blake, Humbert heroically, and in face of a rampant British associationism, attempted to expose the enduring elements of cultural and social life.Symbol and Myth also prefigures [Body Criticism] in another important way. It contains an interpretation of the body as a system of abstractable signs absolutely inscribed, and thus clearly legible, in a vast corpus of ancient and modern monuments. One of my goals in Voyage into Substance was to look at nature from within, from its own animated internal perspective as an autonomous creating agency. This vitalist view stood in opposition to the anthropocentric rational examination of nature from without, analyzed as a mechanical or dead machine. The growth of experimental science during the Enlightenment emphasized visual evidence, demonstration of function, and actual trials or practice. Thus it provides a salutary physical counter-model to the hegemony of the mental and the conceptual in all spheres of existence. This corporeal or physiological form of knowing was grounded in handling, in the frank manipulation of materials, and in the pleasure and discoveries of sight. \u2026 A major intention of Voyage into Substance was to show that a Baconian empirical tradition offered different outlooks upon, and possible solutions to, both ancient and modern dilemmas. \u2026 Voyage further [exposes] the eighteenth century desire to capture the imperceptible.\u201d\u201dJust as Symbol and Myth recuperated the visible, \u201cunconditional\u201d sign language of ancient monuments, and Voyage into Substance traced the emergence of self-picturing natural hieroglyphics, so Body Criticism focuses on key pictorial strategies for externalizing the internal. The difficulties of imaging the body illuminate that supreme representational problem: how does one seize the liquid inner and outer of things? How do we gain visual knowledge and come to imaginatively possess all that cannot be consumed, or subsumed, by words? [Body Criticism], therefore, should be seen as rounding out a trilogy, one whose dominant theme has been the increasing visualization of knowledge in the modern period.\u201d", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Stafford__Symbol_and_Myth/Stafford__Symbol_and_Myth.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Stafford__Symbol_and_Myth/Stafford__Symbol_and_Myth.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Stafford__Symbol_and_Myth/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Stafford__Symbol_and_Myth/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Stafford__Symbol_and_Myth/Stafford SaM.zip"]},

Immanuel Kant and Johann Wolfgang Goethe described the architect as their equal, a genius with godlike creativity. For writers from Descartes to Freud, architectural reasoning provided a method for critically examining consciousness. The architect, as philosophers liked to think of him, was obligated by the design and construction process to mediate between the abstract and the actual.In On the Ruins of Babel, Daniel Purdy traces this notion back to its wellspring. He surveys the volatile state of architectural theory in the Enlightenment, brought on by the newly emerged scientific critiques of Renaissance cosmology, then shows how German writers redeployed Renaissance terminology so that \u201charmony,\u201d \u201cunity,\u201d \u201csynthesis,\u201d \u201cfoundation,\u201d and \u201corderliness\u201d became states of consciousness, rather than terms used to describe the built world. Purdy\u2019s distinctly new interpretation of German theory reveals how metaphors constitute interior life as an architectural space to be designed, constructed, renovated, or demolished. He elucidates the close affinity between Hegel\u2019s Romantic aesthetic of space and Daniel Libeskind\u2019s deconstruction of monumental architecture in Berlin\u2019s Jewish Museum.Through a careful reading of Walter Benjamin\u2019s writing on architecture as myth, Purdy details how classical architecture shaped Benjamin\u2019s modernist interpretations of urban life, particularly his elaboration on Freud\u2019s archaeology of the unconscious.

Thus the \u2018classical\u2019 does not concern only the past: it is also concerned with the present and a vision of the future. In this elegant new book, Salvatore Settis traces the ways in which we have related to our \u2018classical\u2019 past, starting with post-modern American skyscrapers and working his way back through our cultural history to the attitudes of the Greeks and Romans themselves.Settis argues that this obsession with cultural decay, ruins and a \u2018classical\u2019 past is specifically European and the product of a collective cultural trauma following the collapse of the Roman Empire. This situation differed from that of the Aztec and Inca empires whose collapse was more sudden and more complete, and from the Chinese Empire which always enjoyed a high degree of continuity. He demonstrates how the idea of the \u2018classical\u2019 has changed over the centuries through an unrelenting decay of \u2018classicism\u2019 and its equally unrelenting rebirth in an altered form. In the Modern Era this emulation of the \u2018ancients\u2019 by the \u2018moderns\u2019 was accompanied by new trends: the increasing belief that the former had now been surpassed by the latter, and an increasing preference for the Greek over the Roman. These conflicting interpretations were as much about the future as they were about the past. No civilization can invent itself if it does not have other societies in other times and other places to act as benchmarks. Settis argues that we will be better equipped to mould new generations for the future once we understand that the \u2018classical\u2019 is not a dead culture we inherited and for which we can take no credit, but something startling that has to be re-created every day and is a powerful spur to understanding the \u2018other\u2019.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Settis__The_Future_of_the_Classical/Settis__The_Future_of_the_Classical.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Settis__The_Future_of_the_Classical/Settis__The_Future_of_the_Classical.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Settis__The_Future_of_the_Classical/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Settis__The_Future_of_the_Classical/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Settis__The_Future_of_the_Classical/Settis TFotC.zip"]},

Between 1560 and 1630, in a spectacular burst of urban renewal, Rome\u0092s religious and civil authorities sponsored the construction of aqueducts, private and public fountains for drinking, washing, and industry, and the magnificent ceremonial fountains that are Rome\u0092s glory. Tying together the technological, sociopolitical, and artistic questions that faced the designers during an age of turmoil in which the Catholic Church found its authority threatened and the infrastructure of the city was in a state of decay, Rinne shows how these public works projects transformed Rome in a successful marriage of innovative engineering and strategic urban planning.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rinne__The_Waters_of_Rome/Rinne__The_Waters_of_Rome.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rinne__The_Waters_of_Rome/Rinne__The_Waters_of_Rome.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rinne__The_Waters_of_Rome/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rinne__The_Waters_of_Rome/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Rinne__The_Waters_of_Rome/Rinne TWoR.zip"]},

It asks the far-reaching question why, when there are five senses, has one single sense \u2013 sight\u2013 become so predominant in architectural culture and design? With the ascendancy of the digital and the all-pervasive use of the image electronically, it is a subject that has become all the more pressing and topical since the first edition\u2019s publication in the mid-1990s. Juhani Pallasmaa argues that the suppression of the other four sensory realms has led to the overall impoverishment of our built environment, often diminishing the emphasis on the spatial experience of a building and architecture\u2019s ability to inspire, engage and be wholly life enhancing. For every student studying Pallasmaa\u2019s classic text for the first time, The Eyes of the Skin is a revelation. It compellingly provides a totally fresh insight into architectural culture. This third edition meets readers\u2019 desire for a further understanding of the context of Pallasmaa\u2019s thinking by providing a new essay by architectural author and educator PeterMacKeith. This text combines both a biographical portrait of Pallasmaa and an outline of his architectural thinking, its origins and its relationship to the wider context of Nordic and European thought, past and present.

The narrative also shifts from France to other cultural arenas, like the modern European colonial sphere, where the overthrow of the Bastille acquired radical new signification in the decolonization period of the 1940s and 1950s.

William Mitchell describes the transformation of wireless technology in the hundred years since Marconi\u2014the scaling up of networks and the scaling down of the apparatus for transmission and reception. It is, he says, as if \u201cBrobdingnag had been rebooted as Lilliput\u201d; Marconi\u2019s massive mechanism of tower and kerosene engine has been replaced by a palm-size cellphone. If the operators of Marconi\u2019s invention can be seen as human appendages to an immobile machine, today\u2019s hand-held devices can be seen as extensions of the human body. This transformation has, in turn, changed our relationship with our surroundings and with each other. The cellphone calls from the collapsing World Trade Center towers and the hijacked jets on September 11 were testimony to the intensity of this new state of continuous electronic engagement.Thus, Mitchell proposes, the \u201ctrial separation\u201d of bits (the elementary unit of information) and atoms (the elementary unit of matter) is over. With increasing frequency, events in physical space reflect events in cyberspace, and vice versa; digital information can, for example, direct the movement of an aircraft or a robot arm. In Me++ Mitchell examines the effects of wireless linkage, global interconnection, miniaturization, and portability on our bodies, our clothing, our architecture, our cities, and our uses of space and time. Computer viruses, cascading power outages, terrorist infiltration of transportation networks, and cellphone conversations in the streets are symptoms of a dramatic new urban condition\u2014that of ubiquitous, inescapable network interconnectivity. He argues that a world governed less and less by boundaries and more and more by connections requires us to reimagine and reconstruct our environment and to reconsider the ethical foundations of design, engineering, and planning practice.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Mitchell__Me_The_Cyborg_Self_and_the_Networked_City/Mitchell__Me_The_Cyborg_Self_and_the_Networked_City.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Mitchell__Me_The_Cyborg_Self_and_the_Networked_City/Mitchell__Me_The_Cyborg_Self_and_the_Networked_City.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Mitchell__Me_The_Cyborg_Self_and_the_Networked_City/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Mitchell__Me_The_Cyborg_Self_and_the_Networked_City/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Mitchell__Me_The_Cyborg_Self_and_the_Networked_City/Mitchell MTCSatNC.zip"]},

It provides a detailed discussion of languages of architectural form, their specification by means of formal grammars, their interpretation, and their role in structuring design thinking. Supplemented by more than 200 original illustrations, The Logic of Architecture reexamines central issues of design theory in the light of recent advances in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and the theory of computation. The richness of this approach permits sympathetic and constructive analysis of positions developed by a wide range of theorists and philosophers from Socrates to the present. Mitchell first considers how buildings may be described in words and shows how such descriptions may be formalized by the notation of first order predicate calculus. This leads to the idea of a critical language for speaking about the qualities of buildings. Turning to the question of representation by drawings and scale models, Mitchell then develops the notion of design worlds that provide graphic tokens which can be manipulated according to certain grammatical rules. In particular, he shows how domains of graphic compositions possible in a design world may be specified by formal shape grammars. Design worlds and critical languages are connected by showing how such languages may be interpreted in design worlds. Design processes are then viewed as computations in a design world with the objective of satisfying predicates of form and function stated in a critical language. William J. Mitchell is G. Ware and Edythe M. Travelstead Professor of Architecture at Harvard University and a founder of the Computer Aided Design Group in Los Angeles.

Claims to the utility of architecture in social formation and the technical aspects of building production, which dominated architecture\u2019s professionalisation in the twentieth century, are now met with tired scepticism. The utility claimed for architecture today -in branding corporations, creating identities for cities, providing the infrastructure of a \u201ccreative economy\u201d -is little different to the sumptuary role that the \u201cautonomous\u201d arts have never quite renounced.Today, the mix of monetary and cultural capital in the building of a state art gallery hardly differs from the kind of investment made in the collection housed. Although the disciplinary distinctions between art and architecture are still prominent and widely observed, they have also become something of a topic or a medium, owing to the effect of particular polemical interdisciplinary projects and the provocative blurring of institutional frameworks.

This book offers a new perspective in the retrieval of meaning from architecture in the Greek East and the Latin West, and challenges the view that geometry was merely an outcome of practical procedures by masons. Instead, it attributes intellectual meaning to it as understood by Christian Platonist thought and provides compelling evidence that the symbolism was often intended. In so doing, the book serves as a companion volume to The Wise Master Builder by the same author, which found the same system implicit in plans of cathedrals and abbeys. The present book explains how the architectural symbolism proposed could have been understood at the time, as supported by medieval texts and its context, since it is context that can confer specific meaning. The introduction locates the study in its critical context and summarizes Christian Platonism as it determined the meaning of number and geometry. The investigation opens with the recurrent symbolism of the dome and the cube as heaven and earth in the Byzantine world and moves to the duality of the temple and the body in the East and West as reflections of Plato\u2019s universal macrocosm and human microcosm. The study then examines each of the figures of Platonic geometry in the architecture of the West against the background of their mathematics and metaphysics, before proceeding to their synthesis with the circle, as seen in circular and polygonal structures, the divisions of circles in Christian art, and their display in window tracery, culminating in the rose window.

While the influence of painting and sculpture would have been commonly accepted in a treatise on the architecture of the 1920\u2019s and 1930\u2019s, this relationship to post-1950 architecture, except in its most literal interpretations, (1) has rarely been the subject for discussion. If for no other reason than the recurrence and persistence of a \u201chard edge\u201d painting and sculpture, which in a very literal sense might be said to be both exemplary of conceptual art and possess architectonic qualities and which would be significant in itself, the problems raised by this recent painting and sculpture seem to have a very direct concern for architecture. While hard edge, essentially abstract, and formal phenomena have not been the only painterly influences on modern architecture (for example, recent \u201cPop\u201d movements with their emphasis on social commentary have had an influence similar to the Dada painters and sculptors of the twenties), their apparent visual similarity alone would be enough to warrant examination. However, to consider this problem in the traditional terms of visual phenomena and associated meanings would be to miss the essential interest of conceptual attitudes and consequently the thesis of this article. While the intention here is not to become involved in a \u201csemantic\u201d debate over what is or is not \u201cconceptual,\u201d (2) a clarification of the term and its implications might prove illuminating to the present climate of debate in contemporary architecture.

The question may be simple but there is no easy answer, and Professor Gombrich\u2019s brilliant and wide-ranging exploration of the history and psychology of pictorial representation leads him into countless crucial areas. Gombrich examines, questions and re-evaluates old and new ideas on such matters as the imitation of nature, the function of tradition, the problem of abstraction, the validity of perspective and the interpretation of expression: all of which reveal that pictorial representation is far from being a straightforward matter. First published more than 40 years ago, Art and Illusion has lost none of its vitality and importance. In applying the findings of experimental science to a nuanced understanding of art and in tackling complex ideas and theoretical issues, Gombrich is rigorous. Yet he always retains a sense of wonder at the inexhaustible capacity of the human brain, and at the subtlety of the relationships involved in seeing the world and in making and seeing art. With profound knowledge and his exceptional gift for clear exposition, he advances each argument as an hypothesis to be tested.

Architecture, paintings, poetry, music, natural science and new forms of piety all have their places on the Baroque map. In this surprising reinterpretation of the Baroque, Robert Harbison offers new readings that stress its eccentric and tumultuous forms, in which a destablized sense of reality is often projected onto the viewer. This strange, subjectively inclined world is manifested in such bizarre phenomena as the small stuccoed universes of Giacomo Serpotta, the Sacred Mounts of Piedmont and the grimacing heads of F. X. Messerschmidt. Harbison explores the Baroque\u2019s metamorphoses into later styles, particularly the Rococo, and, in an unexpected twist, pursues the Baroque idea into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, proposing provocative analyses of pastiches or imitations (in Der Rosenkavalier and the work of Aubrey Beardsley) or resemblances (deliberate or not) in Czech Cubism and Frank Gehry\u2019s architecture.

It exudes Cook\u2019s delight and catholic appetite for the architectural. Readers are provided with perceptive insights at every turn. The book features some of the greatest and most intriguing drawings by architects, ranging from Frank Lloyd Wright, Heath-Robinson, Le Corbusier, and Otto Wagner to Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Coop Himmelb(l)au, Arata Isozaki, Eric Owen Moss, Bernard Tschumi, and Lebbeus Woods; as well as key works by Cook and other members of the original Archigram group.For this new edition, Cook provides a substantial new chapter that charts the speed at which the trajectory of drawing is moving.It reflects the increasing sophistication of available software and also the ways in which \u2018hand drawing\u2019 and the \u2018digital\u2019 are being eclipsed by new hybrids\u2014injecting a new momentum to drawing.These \u2018crossovers\u2019 provide a whole new territory as attempts are made to release drawing from the boundaries of a solitary moment, a single-viewing position, or a single referential language.Featuring the likes of Toyo Ito, Perry Culper, Izaskun Chinchilla,Kenny Tsui, Ali Rahim, John Berglund, and Lorene Faure, it leads to fascinating insights into the effect that medium has upon intention and definition of an idea or a place. Is a pencil drawing more attuned to a certain architecture than an ink drawing, or is a particular colour evocative of a certain atmosphere? In a world where a Mayer drawing is creatively contributing something different from a Rhino drawing, there is much to demand of future techniques.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Cook__Drawing/Cook__Drawing.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Cook__Drawing/Cook__Drawing.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Cook__Drawing/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Cook__Drawing/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Cook__Drawing/Cook D.zip"]},

By exploiting the semantic richness of the image of the temple, Lemaire was able to combine panegyric of his patrons with advertisement of his own talents and to promote an ideology of the self-conscious and self-confident writer that was to characterize the stance of Ronsard and the Pl\u00e9iade in the poet-architect debate of the later sixteenth century.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Cowling__Building_the_Text/Cowling__Building_the_Text.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Cowling__Building_the_Text/Cowling__Building_the_Text.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Cowling__Building_the_Text/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Cowling__Building_the_Text/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Cowling__Building_the_Text/Cowling BtT.zip"]},

The discipline of architecture depends on the transmission in space and time of accumulated experiences, concepts, rules, and models. From the invention of the alphabet to the development of ASCII code for electronic communication, the process of recording and transmitting this body of knowledge has reflected the dominant information technologies of each period. In this book Mario Carpo discusses the communications media used by Western architects, from classical antiquity to modern classicism, showing how each medium related to specific forms of architectural thinking. Carpo highlights the significance of the invention of movable type and mechanically reproduced images. He argues that Renaissance architectural theory, particularly the system of the five architectural orders, was consciously developed in response to the formats and potential of the new printed media. Carpo contrasts architecture in the age of printing with what preceded it: Vitruvian theory and the manuscript format, oral transmission in the Middle Ages, and the fifteenth-century transition from script to print. He also suggests that the basic principles of \u201ctypographic\u201d architecture thrived in the Western world as long as print remained our main information technology.

Digital technologies have changed architecture\u2013 the way it is taught, practiced, managed, and regulated. But if the digital has created a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d for architecture, which paradigm is shifting? In The Alphabet and the Algorithm, Mario Carpo points to one key practice of modernity: the making of identical copies. Carpo highlights two examples of identicality crucial to the shaping of architectural modernity: in the fifteenth century, Leon Battista Alberti\u2019s invention of architectural design, according to which a building is an identical copy of the architect\u2019s design; and, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the mass production of identical copies from mechanical master models, matrixes, imprints, or molds. The modern power of the identical, Carpo argues, came to an end with the rise of digital technologies. Everything digital is variable. In architecture, this means the end of notational limitations, of mechanical standardization, and of the Albertian, authorial way of building by design. Charting the rise and fall of the paradigm of identicality, Carpo compares new forms of postindustrial digital craftsmanship to hand-making and the cultures and technologies of variations that existed before the coming of machine-made, identical copies. Carpo reviews the unfolding of digitally based design and construction from the early 1990s to the present, and suggests a new agenda for architecture in an age of variable objects and of generic and participatory authorship.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Carpo__The_Alphabet_and_the_Algorithm/Carpo__The_Alphabet_and_the_Algorithm.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Carpo__The_Alphabet_and_the_Algorithm/Carpo__The_Alphabet_and_the_Algorithm.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Carpo__The_Alphabet_and_the_Algorithm/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Carpo__The_Alphabet_and_the_Algorithm/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Carpo__The_Alphabet_and_the_Algorithm/Carpo TAatA.zip"]},

But today\u2019s digitally intelligent architecture no longer looks that way. In The Second Digital Turn, Mario Carpo explains that this is because the design professions are now coming to terms with a new kind of digital tools they have adopted\u2014no longer tools for making but tools for thinking. In the early 1990s the design professions were the first to intuit and interpret the new technical logic of the digital age: digital mass-customization (the use of digital tools to mass-produce variations at no extra cost) has already changed the way we produce and consume almost everything, and the same technology applied to commerce at large is now heralding a new society without scale\u2014a flat marginal cost society where bigger markets will not make anything cheaper. But today, the unprecedented power of computation also favors a new kind of science where prediction can be based on sheer information retrieval, and form finding by simulation and optimization can replace deduction from mathematical formulas. Designers have been toying with machine thinking and machine learning for some time, and the apparently unfathomable complexity of the physical shapes they are now creating already expresses a new form of artificial intelligence, outside the tradition of modern science and alien to the organic logic of our mind.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Carpo__The_Second_Digital_Turn/Carpo__The_Second_Digital_Turn.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Carpo__The_Second_Digital_Turn/Carpo__The_Second_Digital_Turn.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Carpo__The_Second_Digital_Turn/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Carpo__The_Second_Digital_Turn/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Carpo__The_Second_Digital_Turn/Carpo TSDT.zip"]},

Roughly speaking, hybridity refers to something new that emerges from the combination of diverse older elements. (The term hybridization is preferable to \u2018hybridity\u2019 because it refers to a process rather than to a state, and also because it encourages the writer and the readers alike to think in terms of degree: where there is more or less, rather than presence versus absence.) The book begins with a discussion of the concept of cultural hybridization and a cluster of other concepts related to it. Then comes a geography of cultural hybridization focusing on three locales: courts, major cities (whether ports or capitals) and frontiers. The following seven chapters describe the hybridity of the Renaissance in different fields: architecture, painting and sculpture, languages, literature, music, philosophy and law and finally religion. The essay concludes with a brief account of attempts to resist hybridization or to purify cultures or domains from what was already hybridized.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Burke__Hybrid_Renaissance/Burke__Hybrid_Renaissance.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Burke__Hybrid_Renaissance/Burke__Hybrid_Renaissance.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Burke__Hybrid_Renaissance/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Burke__Hybrid_Renaissance/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Burke__Hybrid_Renaissance/Burke HR.zip"]},

Six essays set the reproductions in historical context, and consider the challenges presented by works in various media and with varying degrees of accessibility, while a seventh considers how published verbal descriptions competed with visual reproductions. Rather than concentrating on the intentions of the artist, Barnes treats the prints as important indicators of the use of, and public reaction to, Michelangelo\u2019s works.

The \u2018lamps\u2019 of the title are Ruskin\u2019s principles of architecture, which he later enlarged upon in the three-volume The Stones of Venice. To an extent, they codified some of the contemporary thinking behind the Gothic Revival. At the time of its publication, A. W. N. Pugin and others had already advanced the ideas of the Revival and it was well under way in practice. Ruskin offered little new to the debate, but the book helped to capture and summarize the thoughts of the movement.The essay was published in book form in May 1849 and is structured with eight chapters; an introduction and one chapter for each of the seven \u2018Lamps\u2019, which represent the demands that good architecture must meet, expressed as directions in which the association of ideas may take the observer:1. Sacrifice \u2013 dedication of man\u2019s craft to God, as visible proofs of man\u2019s love and obedience2. Truth \u2013 handcrafted and honest display of materials and structure. Truth to materials and honest display of construction were bywords since the serious Gothic Revival had distanced itself from the whimsical \u201cGothick\u201d of the 18th century; it had been often elaborated by Pugin and others.3. Power \u2013 buildings should be thought of in terms of their massing and reach towards the sublimity of nature by the action of the human mind upon them and the organization of physical effort in constructing buildings.4. Beauty \u2013 aspiration towards God expressed in ornamentation drawn from nature, his creation5. Life \u2013 buildings should be made by human hands, so that the joy of masons and stonecarvers is associated with the expressive freedom given them6. Memory \u2013 buildings should respect the culture from which they have developed7. Obedience \u2013 no originality for its own sake, but conforming to the finest among existing English values, in particular expressed through the \u201cEnglish Early Decorated\u201d Gothic as the safest choice of style.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/ruskin-the-stones-of-venice/", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Ruskin__The_Seven_Lamps_of_Architecture/Ruskin__The_Seven_Lamps_of_Architecture.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Ruskin__The_Seven_Lamps_of_Architecture/Ruskin__The_Seven_Lamps_of_Architecture.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Ruskin__The_Seven_Lamps_of_Architecture/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Ruskin__The_Seven_Lamps_of_Architecture/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Ruskin__The_Seven_Lamps_of_Architecture/Ruskin TSLA.zip"]},

Mumford takes readers from the compact, worker-friendly streets of medieval hamlets to the symmetrical neoclassical avenues of Renaissance cities.

Charting the rise of asceticism in early Christianity and its institutionalisation with the medieval monasteries, Aureli examines how the basic unit of the reclusive life \u2013 the monk\u2019s cell \u2013 becomes the foundation of private property. And from there, he argues, it all starts to go wrong. By late capitalism, asceticism has been utterly aestheticised. It manifests itself as monasteries inspired by Calvin Klein stores, in the monkish lifestyle of Steve Jobs and Apple\u2019s aura of restraint. Amid all the hypocrisy, it must still be possible to reprise the idea of \u201cless\u201d as a radical alternative, as the first step to living the life examined.Pier Vittorio Aureli is an architect and writer.

This idea may be radical (it implies a radical transformation of the architectural profession) but it comes simply from the observation that most of the wonderful places of the world were not made by architects but by the people.At the core of the books, too, is the point that in designing their environments people always rely on certain \u201clanguages,\u201d which, like the languages we speak, allow them to articulate and communicate an infinite variety of designs within a forma system which gives them coherence. This book provides a language of this kind. It will enable a person to make a design for almost any kind of building, or any part of the built environment.\u201cPatterns,\u201d the units of this language, are answers to design problems (How high should a window sill be? How many stories should a building have? How much space in a neighborhood should be devoted to grass and trees?). More than 250 of the patterns in this pattern language are given: each consists of a problem statement, a discussion of the problem with an illustration, and a solution. As the authors say in their introduction, many of the patterns are archetypal, so deeply rooted in the nature of things that it seemly likely that they will be a part of human nature, and human action, as much in five hundred years as they are today.", "links": ["https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Alexander__A_Pattern_Language/Alexander__A_Pattern_Language.pdf", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Alexander__A_Pattern_Language/Alexander__A_Pattern_Language.txt", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Alexander__A_Pattern_Language/html", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Alexander__A_Pattern_Language/jpg", "https://xenotheka.delbeke.arch.ethz.ch/xenotheka/e_Alexander__A_Pattern_Language/Alexander APL.zip"]},

As democracy began emerging in 5th-century Athens, public speaking and debate became an increasingly important tool to garner influence in the assemblies, councils, and law courts of ancient Greece. In response to this, both politicians and ordinary citizens became desperate to learn greater skills in this area, as well as the philosophy behind it. This treatise was one of the first to provide just that, establishing methods and observations of informal reasoning and style, and has continued to be hugely influential on public speaking and philosophy today. Aristotle, the grandfather of philosophy, student of Plato, and teacher of Alexander the Great, was one of the first people to create a comprehensive system of philosophy, encompassing logic, morality, aesthetics, politics, ethics, and science.

Born and trained in England and a U.S. resident starting in 1976, Banham wrote incisively about American and European buildings and culture. Now readers can enjoy a chronological cross-section of essays, polemics, and reviews drawn from more than three decades of Banham\u2019s writings.The volume, which includes discussions of Italian Futurism, Adolf Loos, Paul Scheerbart, and the Bauhaus as well as explorations of contemporary architecture by Frank Gehry, James Stirling, and Norman Foster, conveys the full range of Banham\u2019s belief in industrial and technological development as the motor of architectural evolution. Banham\u2019s interests and passions ranged from architecture and the culture of pop art to urban and industrial design. In brilliant analyses of automobile styling, mobile homes, science fiction films, and the American predilection for gadgets, he anticipated many of the preoccupations of contemporary cultural studies. Los Angeles, the city that Banham commemorated in a book and a film, receives extensive attention in essays on the Santa Monica Pier, the Getty Museum, Forest Lawn cemetery, and the ubiquitous freeway system.Eminently readable, provocative, and entertaining, this book is certain to consolidate Banham\u2019s reputation among architects and students of contemporary culture.
