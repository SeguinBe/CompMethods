In the case of `len()`, the argument is the object of which you want to know the length, for `print()` it can be any number of objects you want to print. The syntax of `split()` is different because it cannot be used as a standalone function. Instead it must always be called on a string object. It is attached to this object using dot notation: `string.split()`, so e.g.:\n",
