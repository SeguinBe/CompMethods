# DigMethods

For the first week, we will use binder to simplify running it [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SeguinBe/DigMethods/master).

This course material heavily borrows from: 

- 'Python for the Humanities', a course by Folgert Karsdorp and Maarten van Gompel.
- 'Introduction to Programming with Python', which is itself based on the previous reference, with modifications and contributions by Mike Kestemont, Lars Wieneke, Bart Desmet, Gilles Jacobs, and Patrick Goethals.
